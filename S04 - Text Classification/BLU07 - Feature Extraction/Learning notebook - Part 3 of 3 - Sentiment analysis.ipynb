By using `CountVectorizer()` with the parameter `ngram_range`, we can easily get all the possibilities in a chosen range of N. This parameter takes a tuple `(min_n, max_n)`, where `min_n` is the smallest N-gram size (e.g., 1 for unigrams), and `max_n` is the largest N-gram size (e.g., 3 for trigrams).
