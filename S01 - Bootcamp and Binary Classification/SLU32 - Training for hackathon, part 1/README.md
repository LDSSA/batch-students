# S32 Training for the hackathon, part 1

This SLU is optional, to be done after completing the SLUs 01-10. It is meant to prepare you for the hackathon. In this first part of the training, you will do the EDA, clean your data, and set up your first model (baseline).

This SLU does not have exercises with asserts like you have done until now, it is just a guided tour.
