    "Let's spend a minute thinking about these concepts. In data science, constructing a **model** means to find a **relationship** between a number of **variables** and an **outcome** (which is also a variable from the point of view of tidy datasets). Each column of a tidy dataset consists of values measured for the same variable (like height) across multiple units (people). Each row consists of values measured on the same unit (like person) across multiple attributes (height, age, ...). In some cases it is completely obvious what are the variables, in others it requires some deliberation to identify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple **example of a model** is the dependence of an apartment price on the number of rooms, the apartment area and the apartment location. In this example, the **variables** are the numbers of rooms, the area, and the location. The **outcome** is the price. To efficiently deal with this dataset, it should be stored in a **table** (represented by a pandas dataframe) with **four columns**, one for each of the **three variables** and one for the **outcome**. **Each row** of the dataframe should contain the values of all variables and the outcome for one **observation** (one apartment).\n",
    "\n",
    "One immediately obvious advantage of tidy datasets is that the **values for different observations and variables can be accessed in the same way** - using the column/row addressing of dataframes. Tidy datasets are also easy to manipulate, model and visualize using **tidy tools**. Tidy tools are functions and methods that expect tidy inputs and produce tidy outputs, like many of those in pandas."

Data can be missing for two reasons: it was not recorded (failure in data collection) or it does not exist (e.g. missing driving license number for children). There is no way to deal with non-existent data except for excluding it from the analysis. For not recorded data, there are basically three strategies: \n",
    "- **drop**: best stratedy when we have large amounts of missing values \n",

We can do it using the method [`dropna()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html).

Outlier removal should not be done automatically and should be based on a very good reason. Otherwise you might miss something important, such as the formation of a [hole in the ozone layer](https://www.math.uni-augsburg.de/htdocs/emeriti/pukelsheim/1990c.pdf).
