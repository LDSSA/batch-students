Low margin training test datasets often effectively reduced training along reduction training test error ; high margin may exhibit different dynamic reflecting trade-off expressive power model complexity data . When data complexity comparable model expressiveness high margin distribution training test data undergo similar decrease-increase phase transition training . In case one predict trend generalization test error margin-based generalization bound restricted Rademacher complexity shown two way paper early stopping time exploiting phase transition . On hand over-expressive model may low high training margin undergoing uniform improvement distinct phase transition test margin dynamic . This reconfirms Breiman 's dilemma associated overparameterized neural network margin fail predict overfitting .,2020,Machine Learning,4
