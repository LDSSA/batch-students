### How to use Slack nicely and effectively
Slack is our official communication channel. We will announce the release of the weekly learning materials and answer all your questions there. To make it a pleasant and productive experience for everyone, please follow these rules:

1. For your sanity, set how and when you want to be notified in `Preferences` -> `Notifications`.
1. You can install the Slack app on your phone.
1. Use the channel of the Week you're asking about for questions about the learning material.
1. Use the #setup channel for technical questions.
1. Check if your question was already asked before posting.
1. Always answer in a thread, it helps keep the conversations organized.
1. Use `Shift`+`Enter` for newlines, just `Enter` will send the message.
1. If you want to report bugs in the materials, you can open an issue on the ds-prep-course-2023 [repo](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2023/issues/).
1. If you want to give feedback post it in the #feedback channel.
1. Anything not related with the learning materials should go to the #random channel.
