# Slack usage and how to ask for help

### New to Slack?
Slack is a messaging app for team communication. If you are new to Slack, check out this short [intro](https://slack.com/help/articles/360059928654-How-to-use-Slack--your-quick-start-guide). You can find more tutorials [here](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049063).

### How to use Slack nicely and effectively
Slack is our official communication channel. We will announce the release of the weekly learning materials and answer all your questions there. To make it a pleasant and productive experience for everyone, please follow these rules:

1. For your sanity, set how and when you want to be notified in `Preferences` -> `Notifications`.
1. You can install the Slack app on your phone.
1. Check if your question was already asked before posting.
1. Use the channel of the learning unit you're asking about for questions about the learning material. Indicate the relevant section or exercise.
1. Use the #devops channel for technical questions.
1. Always answer in a thread, it helps keep the conversations organized.
1. Use `Shift`+`Enter` for newlines, just `Enter` will send the message.
1. If you want to report bugs in the materials, you can open an issue on the batch7-students [repo](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch7-students/issues/).
1. If you want to give feedback post it in the #feedback channel.
1. Anything not related with the learning materials should go to the #random channel.
