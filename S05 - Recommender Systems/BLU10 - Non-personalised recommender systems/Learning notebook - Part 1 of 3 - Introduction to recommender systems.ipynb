    "In this specialization, we'll talk about the algorithms that are behind product recommendations on online product platforms like Netflix or Amazon. Typical data sets in these cases contain a huge amount of missing data, more than the actual data points. We'll look into a handy data structure to store these data sets - a sparse matrix - a sophisticated way to represent very large and mostly empty matrices."

    "**Recommender Systems** (RS) are commonly used in companies providing a large amount of similar content (e.g. movies/shows on Netflix, songs/podcasts on Spotify, items on Amazon). Since these companies cannot ask all users to rate every single item (Spotify has +50 million tracks and 489 million active users), recommender systems enable the companies to suggest new content both for users which already showed their preferences and to new customers they don't know anything about.\n",

    "\n",
    "A recommender system aims to predict the best possible ranking of items for a user. If we are trying to predict a rating, with rating being a numerical value, why can't we consider this as a classical regression or an ordinal classification \\*[1] problem? The main aspect of recommender systems (when compared to typical classification/regression problems) is that we are solving a high-sparsity problem (meaning, there are a lot of missing values!). We normally have a severe imbalance for unlabeled data, so we consider this task as a matrix completion problem.\n",

    ">*[1] Ordinal classification is a classification problem where the labels have an order (e.g. predicting ratings of movies where a higher rating indicates a better movie). Typical classifications problem, such as predicting the weather labels (rain vs sunny vs cloudy) do not have an intrinsic order (sunny is not less or more than cloudy).*"

    "**Youtube**: Google-powered, their video recommendation system uses content (e.g. metadata) and user activity data (implicit and explicit) and it is responsible for 60% of video clicks from the home page. For curious minds, here is a link to their [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sujoy_Gupta2/publication/221140967_The_YouTube_video_recommendation_system/links/53e834410cf21cc29fdc35d2/The-YouTube-video-recommendation-system.pdf).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Netflix**: by mixing implicit and explicit feedback, the media services provider uses an interface with top-down right-to-left ranking for suggested personalized content. They use your interactions with the service, similarity to other members' tastes and metadata about the titles (e.g. genre, actors) to feed their recommendation system.

    "**Non-personalized systems** are systems where the recommendations are the same for all users or all users within a group. These are useful in situations when we have no information about the user, such as for new users. Typically, we are recommending generally popular items or items liked by similar users, with strategies like:\n",
    "- Best seller\n",
    "- Trending hot\n",
    "- Highest rated\n",
    "- People who like X also like Y\n",

    "**Personalized systems** make tailor-made recommendations for each user. We can use such systems if we have information on the user history.\n",
