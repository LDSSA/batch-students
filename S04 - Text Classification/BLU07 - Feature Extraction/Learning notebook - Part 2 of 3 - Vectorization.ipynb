Remember those nice tidy datasets where each sample was a row in a table and each feature was a column? Well, in those data, each sample was a vector in the feature space. Feature space is an n-dimensional space where each axis represents the values of a feature. Every sample from the dataset is a point in that space whose coordinates are that sample's feature values.\n",

In that case, the feature space is the **vocabulary** of all the words in our documents and the vector of each document is represented by the count of each word in the given document."

Only problem, I feel sometimes no explanations are needed because they can create plot holes and just the feeling of wanting your own explanation. Well, I would highly recommend this movie for lion King fans or just a night with the family. It's a fun flick with the same laughs and lovable characters as the first. So, hopefully, I'll get the same with the third installment to the Lion King series. Sit back and just think Hakuna Matata! It means no worries! <br /><br />8/10\n"

    "\n",
    "We created our bag of words using individual words, or unigrams. In principle, we could have used other N-grams as features if we considered that this makes sense for the given classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to mention that the number of features grows with *N*. Using bigrams gives us roughly twice as many features as the word count of the corpus, trigrams three times as many, and so on. This makes the resulting dataframe sparser (vectors with many zeros), introducing more complexity and noise and potentially harming the machine learning model's ability to find patterns in the data. Additionally, with larger datasets, the vocabulary size already becomes bigger by itself, so combining this with N-grams with *N* > 1 has an even bigger effect on data sparsity.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, using N-grams as features partially preserves word order information, which may be useful for some tasks!\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the choice of *N* to use in document vectorization should take into account both these advantages and disadvantages. You'll see this decision-making process in action in the next notebook."
