    "In this notebook, you'll be introduced to the wonderful world of getting data from [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) (Application Programming Interfaces).\n",
    "And APIs really are a fantastic data source because they can usually give you access to structured data, very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before learning about APIs, we need to take a step back and learn more about the process that allows us to communicate with them, which is through HTTP requests - in particular, the GET request."

    "## 2. What is HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), which means Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the protocol used for data communication in the [Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web).\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't go into much detail about HTTP here. We'll just introduce you to the basics of what it's used for and how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "When two hosts communicate in the Web, there is usually a **client-server** relationship between them. The client is the host that requests resources, and the server is the host that retrieves and sends them as a response.\n",
    "An example of this relationship happens when you surf the Web. Imagine you want to read Sam's [blog post](https://medium.com/lisbon-data-science-academy/in-the-name-of-love-for-data-science-e5588d31b248) about our Academy: there is a client, which is your web browser, that will request a web page to a server, which is the machine hosting [Medium's](https://medium.com/) website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, HTTP is the protocol that establishes the rules for the communication between the client and the server.\n",
    "These rules are pretty simple: they say that the communication starts with the client sending a **Request** message to the server, followed by the server sending a **Response** message to the client.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2.1 Request message\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTTP request message has two main elements: the **URL** and the **method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The URL is the address where the web resource we want to retrieve lives in. For example, when your browser wants to load the Lisbon Data Science Academy's website, it sends a request message with the URL https://www.lisbondatascience.org/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the method is like a keyword that spells out the kind of action we're asking the server to do. Here are the most common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GET**: used to download a resource from the server, e.g. opening a blog post from Medium in our browser.\n",
    "* **POST**: used to upload something new to the server, e.g. creating a new blog post in Medium.\n",
    "* **PUT**: used to update something that already exists in the server, e.g. adding some lines to an existing blog post in Medium.\n",
    "* **DELETE**: used to delete something from the server, e.g. deleting a blog post in Medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the methods represent actions, they can also be referred to as HTTP verbs."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "### 2.2 Response message\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the HTTP response message, the two elements that we're most interested in are the **status code** and the **content**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The status code is a number that tells us if the request was successful or if there's an issue. If there's a problem, the status code provides details about what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are hundreds of different status codes, which you can consult [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, they are structured in a clever way, which allows us to \"survive\" by knowing only three patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2xx** = Success - your request had a good outcome!\n",
    "* **4xx** = Client error, something is wrong with the way you're doing your request, so you should fix it\n",
    "* **5xx** = Server error, something is wrong with the server - you won't get what you're requesting \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's get into the response message content. This is where the server speaks back to the client. Depending on the request type and how things went down, the content can be many things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- in case the request was a GET and it was successful, the response content will be the resource that was requested, like a web page (which is in fact an HTML file).\n",
    "- in case the request was a POST and it was successful, the response content will usually be the location of the newly created entity, for instance, in our blog post example, the content could be the id of the new blog post.\n",
    "- in case the request was not successful, the content will usually be a descriptive error message, that allows to better understand what went wrong with our request.\n",
    "- there's also a special case when the response has no content. In this case, the response has the 204 status code, which tells us that the server processed the request successfully, but no content was returned."

   "source": [
    "### 2.3 Header\n",
    "\n",
    "Both in the request and response messages, there's another important element, which is the **header**.\n",
    "The header contains parameters that are necessary for the communication between the client and the server to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two examples of such parameters are the **authentication** fields and **cookies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's common for a server to require some form of authentication from the client in order to respond to its requests.\n",
    "Authentication can happen in many forms, for instance a [username and password pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) or a [token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token). Authentication data is usually sent to the server in the request header.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that the server doesn't keep track of the interactions it has with the client. This means that the requests sent from the client to the server are independent from each other. \n",
    "However, it is often useful that the server keeps track of its interactions with the client - for instance, when a user is logged in on a web site.\n",
    "This can be achieved with a [cookie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie), which is a unique identifier that the client sends in the header of its requests to the server, allowing the server to keep track of the identity of the client."

    "In general, an API is the point of contact between an entity and the other entities that wish to communicate with it. Think of it as the bridge between two parties. The API sets the ground rules, kind of like a communication guide, outlining how these other entities should behave during their interaction. It's a way of ensuring a smooth and structured exchange of information.\n",

    "The process of getting an authentication form (like a username and password or a token) depends a lot on the API: some require you to fill a form with information about yourself and why you want to access the API, some will give you a token right away, some will ask you to pay something...\n",

    "And then, you have to go to your profile settings in order to access an API Key.\n",
