    "In our case we don't know what was the reason of the data distribution changes, so we'd like to train a model on the new dataset. The only thing is the size of the dataset. The original dataset had around 70k rows and our new set has only 2000. It's not enough to train a good model, so this time we're going to combine both datasets and add a new feature helping the model to distinguish between these periods. If we had more data, it would probably be better to train a completely new model."
