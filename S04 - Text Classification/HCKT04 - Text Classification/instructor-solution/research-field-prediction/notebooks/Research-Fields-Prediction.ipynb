       "4     Bundle recommendation aim recommend user bundle item whole . Nevertheless usually neglect diversity user 's intent adopting item fail disentangle user 's intent representation . In real scenario bundle recommendation user 's intent may naturally distributed different bundle user ( Global view ) bundle may contain multiple intent user ( Local view ) . Each view advantage intent disentangling : 1 ) From global view item involved present intent demonstrate user 's preference intent clearly . 2 ) From local view reveal association among item intent since item within bundle highly correlated . To end propose novel model named Multi-view Intent Disentangle Graph Networks ( MIDGN ) capable precisely comprehensively capturing diversity user 's intent item ' association finer granularity . Specifically MIDGN disentangles user 's intent two different perspective respectively : 1 ) In global level MIDGN disentangles user 's intent coupled inter-bundle item ; 2 ) In Local level MIDGN disentangles user 's intent coupled item within bundle . Meanwhile compare user 's intent disentangled different view contrast learning framework improve learned intent . Extensive experiment conducted two benchmark datasets demonstrate MIDGN outperforms state-of-the-art method 10.7 % 26.8 % respectively .   \n",

    "\n",
    "To establish a baseline, we use **Logistic Regression**, a simple yet effective classifier for text classification tasks. The key reasons for using it as a baseline are:\n",
    "* It is computationally efficient.\n",
    "* It provides interpretability.\n",
    "* It helps measure the improvement gained by using more complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our input data consists of research paper abstracts, we need to preprocess the text before training the model. The **preprocessing pipeline** includes:\n",
    "* Tokenization: Splitting text into words using WordPunctTokenizer().\n",
    "* Stemming: Reducing words to their root form using SnowballStemmer().\n",
    "* Text Cleaning: Removing unwanted characters (e.g., HTML tags).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Extraction**:\n",
    "* CountVectorizer(): Converts text into a bag-of-words representation or\n",
    "* TfidfTransformer(): Converts word counts into TF-IDF scores, giving more weight to important words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training**:\n",
    "* The preprocessed text is used to train a Logistic Regression classifier with max_iter=10,000 to ensure convergence.\n",
    "* We implement this approach using a Scikit-learn pipeline, which automates preprocessing and training.\n",

    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "* **Domain-Specific Training**: Trained on 1.14M scientific papers from Semantic Scholar across biomedical and computer science domains.\n",
    "* **Vocabulary Optimization**: Uses SciVocab, a domain-specific vocabulary derived from scientific texts, instead of the original BERT WordPiece vocabulary.\n",
    "* **Performance**: Outperforms BERT in scientific NLP tasks such as named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction, text classification, and sentence similarity.\n",
