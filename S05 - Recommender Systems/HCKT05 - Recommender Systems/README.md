## **Overview**

Welcome to the **LDSSA Hackathon #5 - Hotel Recommendation Systems**! ðŸš€

You have been hired by **Trippyâ„¢, an emerging hotel review and recommendation platform**. Trippy helps travelers
discover and book the best hotels based on reviews from other users. The company wants to leverage data science and
machine learning to **improve hotel recommendations** for its users, making sure they get highly relevant hotel
suggestions based on past experiences and preferences.

Your goal is to build a **hotel recommendation system** that helps Trippy users find the best hotel recommendations
tailored to their past interactions.

---

## **Task**

Your task is to build a **personalized hotel recommendation system** using user reviews.
The system should generate hotel recommendations for users based on the available review dataset.

---

## **Dataset**

You will be working with the **HotelRec Dataset**, which consists of:

- **Filtered_HotelRec_Main_CSV.zip** â€“ The primary dataset containing date, user_id, hotel_id and rating.
- **Filtered_HotelRec_Metadata_CSV.zip** â€“ Additional metadata related to the hotels.

### **Columns in the dataset**:

- `user_id`  - Unique ID representing a user.
- `hotel_id`  - Unique ID representing a hotel.
- `rating`  - User rating for the hotel.
- `title`  - Review title (only reviews with titles are included).
- `text`  - Full review text.
- `sleep_quality`, `value`, `rooms`, `service`, `cleanliness`, `location` (float) - Additional review categories.
- `date`  - Date of review.

**Objective:**
Using this dataset, generate a **ranked list of hotel recommendations** for each user.

---

## **Evaluation Criteria**

- **performance Rank (50%)** â€“ How well your recommendations perform, measured by MAP@10.
- **Presentation Rank (50%)** â€“ How well your team presents its work.

---

## **Submission Format**

Your team should submit a json file in the following format:

```json
{
    "user_id1": ["recommended_hotel1", "recommended_hotel2", "recommended_hotel3", "recommended_hotel4", "recommended_hotel5"],
    "user_id2": ["recommended_hotel2", "recommended_hotel1", "recommended_hotel34", "recommended_hotel22", "recommended_hotel11"]
}

```

The users for submission should be the ones in submission.json file.

Each user should have a list of **up to 10 recommended hotels**, ranked from most to least relevant.

---

## **Hackathon Rules**

- **Team Formation:** Teams will be randomly assigned.
- **Instructor Support:** Instructors will be available to help with technical questions, but will not provide
  solutions.
- **Submission Limits:** Each team can submit up to **5 times**.
- **Final Presentation:** Each team must present their work in a **4-minute presentation**.

---

## **Presentation Guidelines**

Your presentation should be clear, structured, and informative. Suggested format:

1. **Problem description**
2. **Data cleaning and exploration**
3. **Feature engineering and modeling approach**
4. **Evaluation and results**
5. **Future work & improvements**
6. **A funny pun at the end (VERY IMPORTANT!)**

---

## **Tips for Success, but you are free to do what works best for you**

âœ… **Start with a simple baseline** before improving your model.

ðŸ”¹ A simple most popular hotels approach is a good first step. (print the Top-N Most Popular Hotels)

ðŸ”¹ A random recommender can also serve as a baseline to compare performance.

âœ… **Leverage user and hotel metadata** to improve predictions.

ðŸ”¹ Is it better to use only rows with non-null metadata? Or fill them with the mean?

ðŸ”¹ Print a sample of recommendations for random users after training.

ðŸ”¹ Include an easy sanity check function (e.g., do top-rated hotels actually get recommended?).

âœ… **Optimize for memory and performance** â€“ the dataset is large and preprocessing and memory efficiency are key!

ðŸ”¹ Use pandas astype() to reduce memory footprint by converting data types.

ðŸ”¹ Apply data filtering early (e.g., remove inactive users, missing values) to speed up the processing.

ðŸ”¹ Use batch processing when loading large files.

ðŸ”¹ Consider sparse matrices for large-scale collaborative filtering.

âœ… **Debugging & Model Evaluation**

ðŸ”¹ Run small-scale tests before processing the full dataset.

ðŸ”¹ Check distributions of user reviews â€“ do some users/hotels dominate?

ðŸ”¹ Visualize recommendation results to spot anomalies.

âœ… **Communicate well within your team** to distribute tasks efficiently.

âœ… **Enjoy the hackathon and learn as much as you can!** ðŸŽ‰

**Good luck, and may the best recommendations win!** ðŸŽ¯
