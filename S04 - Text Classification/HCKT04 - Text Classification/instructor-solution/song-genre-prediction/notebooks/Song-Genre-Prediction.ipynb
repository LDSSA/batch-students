Lovers wrapped inside each others lies. Beauty is such a terrible thing. She is suffering yet more than death. She is suffering. She sucks you deeper in. She is suffering. You exist within her shadow. Beauty she is scarred into man's soul. A flower attracting lust vice and sin. A vine that can strangle life from a tree. Carrion surrounding picking on leaves. She is suffering. She sucks you deeper in. She is suffering. You exist within her shadow. Beauty she poisons unfaithful all. Stifled her touch is leprous and pale. The less she gives the more you need her. No thoughts to forget when we were children. She is suffering. She sucks you deeper in. She is suffering. Nature's lukewarm pleasure.   \n",

       "top     Welcome to where time stands still. No one leaves and no one will. Moon is full never seems to change. Just labeled mentally deranged. Dream the same thing every night. I see our freedom in my sight. No locked doors no windows barred. No things to make my brain seem scarred. Sleep my friend and you will see. That dream is my reality. They keep me locked up in this cage. Can't they see it's why my brain says rage. Sanitarium leave me be. Sanitarium just leave me alone. Build my fear of what's out there. And cannot breathe the open air. Whisper things into my brain. Assuring me that I'm insane. They think our heads are in their hands. But violent use brings violent plans. Keep him tied it makes him well. He's getting better can't you tell?. No more can they keep us in. Listen damn it we will win. They see it right they see it well. But they think this saves us from our hell. Sanitarium leave me be. Sanitarium just leave me alone. Sanitarium just leave me alone. Fear of living on. Natives getting restless now. Mutiny in the air. Got some death to do. Mirror stares back hard. Kill it's such a friendly word. Seems the only way. For reaching out again   \n",

I took a job in the steamie down on Cauldrum Street. And I fell in love with a laundry girl who was working next to me. Oh she was a rare thing fine as a bee's wing. So fine a breath of wind might blow her away. She was a lost child oh she was running wild. She said \"As long as there's no price on love I'll stay.. And you wouldn't want me any other way\". Brown hair zig-zag around her face and a look of half-surprise. Like a fox caught in the headlights there was animal in her eyes. She said \"Young man oh can't you see I'm not the factory kind. If you don't take me out of here I'll surely lose my mind\". Oh she was a rare thing fine as a bee's wing. So fine that I might crush her where she lay. She was a lost child she was running wild. She said \"As long as there's no price on love I'll stay.. And you wouldn't want me any other way\". We busked around the market towns and picked fruit down in Kent. And we could tinker lamps and pots and knives wherever we went. And I said that we might settle down get a few acres dug. Fire burning in the hearth and babies on the rug. She said \"Oh man you foolish man it surely sounds like hell.. You might be lord of half the world you'll not own me as well\". Oh she was a rare thing fine as a bee's wing. So fine a breath of wind might blow her away. She was a lost child oh she was running wild. She said \"As long as there's no price on love I'll stay.. And you wouldn't want me any other way\". We was camping down the Gower one time the work was pretty good. She thought we shouldn't wait for the frost and I thought maybe we should. We was drinking more in those days and tempers reached a pitch. And like a fool I let her run with the rambling itch. Oh the last I heard she's sleeping rough back on the Derby beat. White Horse in her hip pocket and a wolfhound at her feet. And they say she even married once a man named Romany Brown. But even a gypsy caravan was too much settling down. And they say her flower is faded now hard weather and hard booze. But maybe that's just the price you pay for the chains you refuse. Oh she was a rare thing fine as a bee's wing. And I miss her more than ever words could say. If I could just taste all of her wildness now. If I could hold her in my arms today. Well I wouldn't want her any other way</td>\n",

Hanging out in the fancy bars. With the boys who can play guitar.. Listen up 'cause I've got to warn ya. She's gonna make it out in California.. Hey you what's a good girl like you.

       "0     I was nineteen when I came to town they called it the Summer of Love. They were burning babies burning flags. The hawks against the doves. I took a job in the steamie down on Cauldrum Street. And I fell in love with a laundry girl who was working next to me. Oh she was a rare thing fine as a bee's wing. So fine a breath of wind might blow her away. She was a lost child oh she was running wild. She said \"As long as there's no price on love I'll stay.. And you wouldn't want me any other way\". Brown hair zig-zag around her face and a look of half-surprise. Like a fox caught in the headlights there was animal in her eyes. She said \"Young man oh can't you see I'm not the factory kind. If you don't take me out of here I'll surely lose my mind\". Oh she was a rare thing fine as a bee's wing. So fine that I might crush her where she lay. She was a lost child she was running wild. She said \"As long as there's no price on love I'll stay.. And you wouldn't want me any other way\". We busked around the market towns and picked fruit down in Kent. And we could tinker lamps and pots and knives wherever we went. And I said that we might settle down get a few acres dug. Fire burning in the hearth and babies on the rug. She said \"Oh man you foolish man it surely sounds like hell.. You might be lord of half the world you'll not own me as well\". Oh she was a rare thing fine as a bee's wing. So fine a breath of wind might blow her away. She was a lost child oh she was running wild. She said \"As long as there's no price on love I'll stay.. And you wouldn't want me any other way\". We was camping down the Gower one time the work was pretty good. She thought we shouldn't wait for the frost and I thought maybe we should. We was drinking more in those days and tempers reached a pitch. And like a fool I let her run with the rambling itch. Oh the last I heard she's sleeping rough back on the Derby beat. White Horse in her hip pocket and a wolfhound at her feet. And they say she even married once a man named Romany Brown. But even a gypsy caravan was too much settling down. And they say her flower is faded now hard weather and hard booze. But maybe that's just the price you pay for the chains you refuse. Oh she was a rare thing fine as a bee's wing. And I miss her more than ever words could say. If I could just taste all of her wildness now. If I could hold her in my arms today. Well I wouldn't want her any other way   \n",

I guess we've lived it out. Something in the air. We smiled to fast then can't think of a thing to say. Lived with the best times. Left with the worst. I've danced with you too long. Nothing left to save. Let's take what we can. I know you hold your head up high. We've raced for the last time. A place of no return. And there's is something in the air. Something in my eye. I've dance with you too long (yeah). Something in the air. Something in my eye. Abracadoo I loose you. We can't avoid the clash. The big mistake. Now we're gonna pay and pay. The sentence of our lives. Can't believe I'm asking you to go. We used what we could. To get the things we want. But we lost each other on the way. I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you. Lived all our best times. Left with the worst. I've danced with you to long. Say what you will. There's something in the air. Raced for the last time. Well I know you'll hold your head up high. But it's nothing we have to say. There's nothing in our eyes. But there's something in the air. Something in my eye. I've danced with you too long. There's something I have to say. There's something in the air. Something in my eye. Do do do do. Do do do do. I've danced with you too long. Do do do do. Do do do do.

Like a movie that is filled with lust. Coming at you with a double D bust.. At the bed of a wounded soldier. In a rush cause she's gettin older.. Hanging out in the fancy bars. With the boys who can play guitar.. Listen up 'cause I've got to warn ya. She's gonna make it out in California.. Hey you what's a good girl like you. Doin' in this crazy world?. Where's the good gone girl?. Dance dance to the life you wanted. When you were only 17. With your good girl dream.. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh good gone girl. Could you believe. The same old phonies. Those painted ponies. That you've ridden all before.. Her name was April. But she was hateful.. Enough to make you. Want to run right out the door.. I can tell you what you want the most. Hanging off with a champagne toast.. When the end of the night gets tricky. Don't you know that beggars can't be picky?. Lookin' out for a man who's golden. Doesn't matter if he's old he's rollin'.. Coming at you like a desperate hunter. Sugar daddy but he's just a munter.. (yes it's munter). Hey you what's a good girl like you. Doin' in this crazy world?. Where's the good gone girl?. Dance dance to the life you wanted. When you were only 17. With your good girl dream.. (x2).

Gone and lost my patience with this hopeless situation. Yeah I'm alive I'm a lonely sole survivor. Spared me for some reason so I'm picking up the pieces. But why? Oh God why?. Go down go down moses.
