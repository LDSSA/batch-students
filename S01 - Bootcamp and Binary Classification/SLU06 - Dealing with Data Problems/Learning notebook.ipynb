    "In a real world scenario, **data is almost never ready** for exploratory analysis, visualization, or modeling. The world is messy and so is its data. Data problems arise from issues in data collection and data entry, and it's not always possible to correct all of these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning messy data often ends up consuming the majority of the data scientist's time. On average, 80 percent of time is spent ensuring that your data is in a clean and workable form, while just 20 percent is dedicated to visualizing and analyzing data, creating machine learning models, or other advanced analytics. **Data cleaning is always the first step** when building a machine learning model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although time consuming, data cleaning saves costs down the line. Ideally, thinking about clean data should start when planning the data collection, but unfortunately the data scientist usually has no influence on this step. According to the 1-10-100 principle, the cost of correcting bad data is 10 times more than the cost of preventing bad data, and the cost of fixing a problem generated by bad data is 100 times more.\n",

    "Let's take a minute to think about these concepts. In data science, constructing a **model** means finding a **relationship** between a number of **variables** and an **outcome** (which also happens to be a variable from the point of view of tidy datasets). Each column of a tidy dataset consists of values measured for the same variable (height) across multiple units (people). Each row consists of values measured on the same unit (person) across multiple attributes (height, age, ...). In some cases, it's completely obvious what are the variables; in others, identifying them requires some deliberation. \n",

    "A simple **example of a model** could reflect the relationship between an apartment's price on the number of its rooms, its area, and its location. In this example, the **variables** are the number of rooms, the area, and the location. The **outcome** is the price. To deal with this dataset efficiently, it should be stored in a **table** (represented by a pandas dataframe) with **four columns**, one for each of the **three variables** and one for the **outcome**. **Each row** of the dataframe should contain the values of all variables and the outcome for one **observation** (one apartment).\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of tidy datasets is that the **values for different observations and variables can be accessed in the same way** by using the columns/rows of dataframes. Tidy datasets are also easy to manipulate, model, and visualize using **tidy tools**, which are functions and methods that expect tidy inputs and produce tidy outputs, like many of those in pandas."

    "\n",
    "Dealing with missing data is not straightforward. It depends on the amount of missing data, the reasons why it's missing, and the judgement of the data scientist. Data can be missing for two reasons: (1) it wasn't recorded (failure in data collection) or (2) it doesn't exist (e.g. missing driving license number for children). Ultimately, your best option is to exclude non-existent data from your analysis. You basically have three strategies: \n",
    "- **Drop**: the best stratedy for large amounts of missing values \n",
    "- **Impute**: fill in values based on known values, which makes sense for smaller amounts of missing data\n",
    "- **Flag**: uses a new variable to indicate values as missing"

    "The simplest way to handle missing values is to discard rows with them. It's the preferred option when we have large amounts of missing values. We can do it using the `dropna()` method (learn about that here: [dropna()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html)), which drops all the rows with missing values from a DataFrame."

The **mean** approach replaces missing values with the value that's most frequent in the values that aren't missing.

Outlier removal shouldn't be done automatically and should be based on sound reasoning. Otherwise, you might miss something important, such as the formation of a [hole in the ozone layer](https://www.math.uni-augsburg.de/htdocs/emeriti/pukelsheim/1990c.pdf).
