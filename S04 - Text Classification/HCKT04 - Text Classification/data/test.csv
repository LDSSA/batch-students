0,"I was nineteen when I came to town they called it the Summer of Love. They were burning babies burning flags. The hawks against the doves. I took a job in the steamie down on Cauldrum Street. And I fell in love with a laundry girl who was working next to me. Oh she was a rare thing fine as a bee's wing. So fine a breath of wind might blow her away. She was a lost child oh she was running wild. She said ""As long as there's no price on love I'll stay.. And you wouldn't want me any other way"". Brown hair zig-zag around her face and a look of half-surprise. Like a fox caught in the headlights there was animal in her eyes. She said ""Young man oh can't you see I'm not the factory kind. If you don't take me out of here I'll surely lose my mind"". Oh she was a rare thing fine as a bee's wing. So fine that I might crush her where she lay. She was a lost child she was running wild. She said ""As long as there's no price on love I'll stay.. And you wouldn't want me any other way"". We busked around the market towns and picked fruit down in Kent. And we could tinker lamps and pots and knives wherever we went. And I said that we might settle down get a few acres dug. Fire burning in the hearth and babies on the rug. She said ""Oh man you foolish man it surely sounds like hell.. You might be lord of half the world you'll not own me as well"". Oh she was a rare thing fine as a bee's wing. So fine a breath of wind might blow her away. She was a lost child oh she was running wild. She said ""As long as there's no price on love I'll stay.. And you wouldn't want me any other way"". We was camping down the Gower one time the work was pretty good. She thought we shouldn't wait for the frost and I thought maybe we should. We was drinking more in those days and tempers reached a pitch. And like a fool I let her run with the rambling itch. Oh the last I heard she's sleeping rough back on the Derby beat. White Horse in her hip pocket and a wolfhound at her feet. And they say she even married once a man named Romany Brown. But even a gypsy caravan was too much settling down. And they say her flower is faded now hard weather and hard booze. But maybe that's just the price you pay for the chains you refuse. Oh she was a rare thing fine as a bee's wing. And I miss her more than ever words could say. If I could just taste all of her wildness now. If I could hold her in my arms today. Well I wouldn't want her any other way"
1,Your coat and hat are gone. I've really can't look at your little empty shelf. A ragged teddy bear. It feels like we never had a chance. Don't look me in the eye. We lay in each others arms. But the room is just an empty space. I guess we've lived it out. Something in the air. We smiled to fast then can't think of a thing to say. Lived with the best times. Left with the worst. I've danced with you too long. Nothing left to save. Let's take what we can. I know you hold your head up high. We've raced for the last time. A place of no return. And there's is something in the air. Something in my eye. I've dance with you too long (yeah). Something in the air. Something in my eye. Abracadoo I loose you. We can't avoid the clash. The big mistake. Now we're gonna pay and pay. The sentence of our lives. Can't believe I'm asking you to go. We used what we could. To get the things we want. But we lost each other on the way. I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you. Lived all our best times. Left with the worst. I've danced with you to long. Say what you will. There's something in the air. Raced for the last time. Well I know you'll hold your head up high. But it's nothing we have to say. There's nothing in our eyes. But there's something in the air. Something in my eye. I've danced with you too long. There's something I have to say. There's something in the air. Something in my eye. Do do do do. Do do do do. I've danced with you too long. Do do do do. Do do do do. Danced with you too long. Do do. Danced with you too long. Something in the air. Something in the air. Do do do do.
3,I met her at the 'Burger King'. We fell in love by the soda machine. So we took the car down town. The kids were hanging out all around. Then we went down to the Coney Island. On the coaster and around again. And no one's gonna ever tear us apart. 'Cause she's my sweetheart. All right oh yea. Oh oh I love her so. Oh oh I love her so. Oh oh I love her so. Oh (2x). Hanging out on a night like this. I'm gonna give her a great big kiss. I'm gonna make her mine. And everything's gonna be real fine. I met her at the 'Burger King'. Fell in love by the soda machine.

13,Your name is being called. We got a deal. We've got to put an end on this. Mom bleeds on her own. Young kids that will never going to grow. A country you won't trust. A small dream at the point of a gun. Honesty down to dust. Your greed just leaving all your sons. A sightseeing of the worst. Concrete blocking people from their love. It might be late. To regain take back what we've lost. How can we forgive. For all they've done. For all they've done to us?. I walk this long road. It's a cold day. I's hard to talk. I have this cold cruel soul. And I can't believe. What I've become. Dead end no return. Street seems to be killing all we've learned. Convicted is what we are. For neglecting the symptoms of this curse. Cold day it's hard to walk. Behold while the city is left to burn. Drunk on fallacies. Sold faith for a buck. When all hope went away. And left a hole in your will. You're all you got. You don't want to give it away. It might be late. To regain take back what we've lost. How can we forgive. For all they've done. All they've done to us?. I walk this long road. It's a cold day. It's hard to talk. I have this cold cruel soul. And I can't believe. What I've become. You mean the whole world to me. But being left I can't let go. Do you need hearts just to break?. Do you know what went away?. An old man is alone. Hoping to be treated like one. He may not know. How many lives could it takes. I walk this long road. It's a cold day. It's hard to talk. I have this cold cruel soul. And I can't believe. What I've become. Fragile state of those who hate. War remained when hope went away. Fragile state of those who hate. War remained when hope went away. Mom bleeds on her own. Dead end no return. Do you know what went away?
14,Ever faithful I endure. To listen for the sound of the siren song. Ragged whispers of imprisoned sisters. Cutting through real life drawing me nearer. The colour of the pure in soul. Like water shall fill the cloudless sky. Try to feel the splendour of it all. Embrace the honesty of nightfall. Try to feel the anguish of it all. Wrap yourself up. In every facet of emotion. Hearts that cry diamond tears. Spirits that walk for a thousand years. Hear them calling on that darkest morning. Pulling me under my thoughts disappear. Can you feel love. Can you feel joy. Can you feel pain. .
16,I feel the flames of your fire. And it's burning my heart. Girl you've got game and my number. And it ain't gonna stop. Hold me love me. Call my name I just want you to feel me. Breathe me tease me. Can't control how I feel. When you're near me. I can't do nothing about it. Got that feeling comin' over me. (Sex sex sex). Girl love is the only remedy. (Sex sex sex). I can't contain my desire and I'm coming apart. I'm just a slave for your pleasure. And I'm waiting to pop. Hold me love me. Call my name I just want you to feel me. Breathe me tease me. Can't control how I feel. When you're near me. I can't do nothing about it. Got that feeling comin' over me. (Sex sex sex). Girl love is the only remedy. (Sex sex sex). Hold me love me. Call my name I just want you to feel me. Breathe me tease me. Can't control how I feel. When you're near me. Hold me love me. Call my name I just want you to feel me. Breathe me tease me. Can't control how I feel. When you're near me. I can't do nothing about it. Got that feeling comin' over me. (Sex sex sex). Girl love is the only remedy. (Sex sex sex). Oh yeah yeah. Got that feeling comin' over me. (Sex sex sex). Girl love is the only remedy. (Sex sex sex). Oh yeah yeah. Got that feeling comin' over me. (Sex sex sex). Girl love is the only remedy. (Sex sex sex)
18,(Punish Me). Punish me. punish me. straw becomes gold. and gold becomes stone. your size makes me small. you may be my punisher. The lord does take. the lord does give. Punish me. punish me. you mean yes. and I think no. include me in your prayers. before the wind blows even colder. Your size makes me small. you may be my punisher. you may be my punisher. Your size makes me small. you may be my punisher. your size makes him small. you will be my punishment.

20,President Joe once had a dream. The world held his hand gave their pledge. So he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine. They called it the Prayer its answer was law. Its logic stopped war gave them food. How they adored till it cried in its boredom. 'Please don't believe in me please disagree with me. Life is too easy a plague seems quite feasible now. or maybe a war or I may kill you all. Don't let me stay don't let me stay. My logic says burn so send me away. Your minds are too green I despise all I've seen. You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine. I need you flying and I'll show that dying. Is living beyond reason sacred dimension of time. I perceive every sign I can steal every mind. Don't let me stay don't let me stay. My logic says burn so send me away. Your minds are too green I despise all I've seen. You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine
22,The children sit upon the stairs. High above a valley of tears. Don't let them see you crying that way oh no. Oh no Joe Porterhouse. Is not gone forever. He'll be back another day. Don't let them see you crying that way. Chorus. Please don't wake him let him sleep. It's a moment she can keep. Like an old bus ticket or a photograph. Resting on the mantlepiece. While for the wicked there is no peace. She says it's not his time to go. Why we were nearly lovers years ago. Now what is left for me. Among the broken branches of the family tree. Heart like an anchor. Arms like cable. He stood all alone on an iron turntable. Don't let them see you crying that way oh no. The sun beats down. It's cracking the flags. Boys who should know better. Are stamping out fags. Don't let them see you laughing that way. Chorus. Oh no Joe Porterhouse. Is not gone forever. He'll be back another day. Don't let them see you crying that way.
23,I'm breaking down gonna start from scratch. Shake it off like an Etch A Sketch. My lips are saying goodbye. My eyes are finally dry. I'm not the way I used to be. I took the record off repeat. You killed me but I survived. And now I'm coming alive. I'll never be that girl again. No oh oh. I'll never be that girl again. No oh oh. My innocence is wearing thin. But my heart is growing strong. So call me call me call me. Miss Movin' On. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. Miss Movin' On. Oh oh oh. I broke the glass that surrounded me. I ain't the way you remember me. I was such a good girl. So fragile but no more. I jumped the fence to the other side (the other side). My whole world was electrified (electrifide). Now I'm no longer afraid. It's Independence Day. (Independence Day). I'll never be that girl again. No oh oh. I'll never be that girl again. No oh oh. My innocence is wearing thin. But my heart is growing strong. So call me call me call me. Miss Movin' On. Everything is changing. And I never wanna go back to the way it was. I'm finding who I am. And who I am from here on out is gonna be enough. It's gonna be enough. It's gonna be enough. I'll never be that girl again. No oh oh. I'll never be that girl again. Oh oh oh. My innocence is wearing thin. But my heart is growing strong. So call me call me call me. Miss Movin' On. Oh oh oh Oh oh oh. Miss Movin' On (On and on and on and on). Oh oh oh Oh oh oh. Miss Movin' On (On and on and on and on...). Oh oh oh Oh oh oh. Miss Movin' On. Oh oh oh (Hey yeah yeah...).

24,It's allright to be held back by retro-man.. it's far fetched fun when you're the one.. The prize.. I knew you would come through.. I thought I could be right number one. but it's a lie.. It's televised in forest green.. it's been brought back by retro-man.. Hold your thoughts in.. It ain't yet over.. You won't slide under me.. The prize.. I knew you would come through.. I thought I could be right number one. but it's a lie.. .
26,Music : Rudolf Schenker. Lyrics: Klaus Meine. Another rainy morning. People rushing by. My head is still in the clouds. I dream with open eyes. Suddenly out of nowhere. She came into my life. Like we know each other. For quite a while. In the sound of silence. Time is standing still. There's some kind of bond between us. That's givin' me the chill. Do you really wonder. That we can burn the sky. It's written a thousand years ago. In the book of life. Are you the one that God had made for me. Are you the one who's always in my dreams. The one who keeps me goin'. When I can't go on. The one that I've been waiting for. For so long. Oh yeah. Suddenly out of nowhere. She came into my life. Are you the one that God had made for me. Are you the one who's always in my dreams. Are you the one that God had made for me. Are you the one who's mine eternally. The one who keeps me dreamin'. When I'm sad and tired. Who gives my life a meaning. Till the day I die. Are you the one
27,Got every reason to feel like I do. From the top of my head to the bottom of my shoes. 'Cos last night my baby took the weight off my mind. Told me everything was gonna be fine. She said she loved me. I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me. 'Cos she says every night hold me tight forever is right. Love is bright moon delight she's outa sight. Give me give me give me love your way. She could have resisted my efforts to pry. But she knows how I feel and she's not exactly shy. Though right now I'm lonely I know it won't be long. I can hear the train comin' bringin' lovin' along. She said she loved me. I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me. 'Cos she says every night hold me tight forever is right. Love is bright moon delight she's outa sight. Give me give me give me love your way. Ooh I used to be so lost and confused. I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried. Was closed before me and knowing that I cried. But still I didn't rest I had to know. What was behind it all I'd come so far. And then I saw her note I couldn't believe she wrote. I couldn't resist it being beside her. Could have held that moment forever in my heart. The moment I saw her was the moment I knew. That her love is my life and her light's shining through. She said she loved me. I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me. 'Cos she says every night hold me tight forever is right. Love is bright moon delight she's outa sight. Give me give me give me love your way. Ooh I used to be so lost and confused. I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried. Was closed before me and knowing that I cried. But still I didn't rest I had to know. What was behind it all I'd come so far. And then I saw her note I couldn't believe she wrote
28,"My best friend Sarah went to Europe for the summer. My brother got kicked out of school; aw bummer.. Julian got laid in the back seat of a Hummer and got arrested..... Like Mel Gibson.. I read in the trades that the NYSNC boy is..... No way!. I threw up in Paris Hilton's closet. I got drunk and totally lose it. When I woke up the first thing that I thought of was. ""oh MY Kesha those hot Jimmy Choos.. Hey Paris did I lose it on that pair too?"". Celebutons work in the glamarazzi. Should've told my story to the tabloids took the. money. Takes a lot to get kicked out of these parties. And almost get arrested..... like Mel Gibson. I don't recall at all that I got like. Fifty phone calls. Omg is that true?!. I threw up in Paris Hilton's closet. I got drunk and totally lose it. When I woke up the first thing that I thought of was. ""Oh no! Kesha with those hot Gucci shoes.. Hey Paris did I lose it on that pair too?"". Of all the stupid things I've done. I'm the proudest of this bra.. But this one's the best!. I threw up in Paris Hilton's closet.

30,Summer nights and long warm days. Are stolen as the old moon falls. My mirror shows another face. Another place to hide it all. Another place to hide it all. And I'm lost behind. The words I'll never find. And I'm left behind. As seasons roll on by. Sleeping with a full moon blanket. Sand and feathers for my head. Dreams have never been the answer. And dreams have never made my bed. Dreams have never made my bed. And I'm lost behind. The words I'll never find. And I'm left behind. As the seasons roll on by. When I wanna fly above the storm. But you can't grow feathers in the rain. And the naked floor is cold as hell. This naked floor reminds me. Oh the naked floor reminds me. And I'm lost behind. Words I'll never find. And I'm left behind. As the seasons roll on by. If I should be short on words. And long on things to say. Could you crawl into my world. And take me worlds away. Should I be beside myself. And never even stay. And I'm lost behind. Words I'll never find. And I'm left behind. As the seasons roll on by
31,You'll never know what you've done for me. what your faith in me has done for my soul. and you'll never know the gift youve given me. I'll carry it with me. through the days ahead I'll think of days before. you made me hope for something better and made me. reach for something more. Chorus:. You taught me to run. You taught me to fly. Helped me to free the me inside. Helped me hear the music of my heart. Helped me hear the music of my heart. You've opened my eyes You've opened the door. To something I've never known before. And your love is the music of my heart. (music of my heart). you were the one. always on my side(always on my side). always standing by (always standing by). seeing me through. you were the song that always made me sing (made me. sing made me sing). im singin this for you (singin this for you babe). everywhere I go I'll think of where I've been. and of the one who knew me better than anyone ever. will again. what you taught me. only your love could ever teach me. you got through when no one could reach me before. 'cuz you always saw in me. all the best that I could be. it was you who set me free. ...is the music of my heart...
32,We met upon a hill the night was cool and still. She sucked my dormant will. Mother she blew my brain I will go back again. My God she shook my cold. I had no time to spare I grabbed her golden hair. And threw her to the ground. Father she caved my head Oh Lord the things she said. My God she should be told. I was very smart broke the gentle hearts. Of many young virgins. I was quick on the ball left them so lonely. They'd just give up trying. Then she took my head smashed it up. Kept my young blood rising. Crushed me mercilessly kept me going around. So she don't know I crave her so-o-o. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh. I'll give my love in vain to reach that peak again. We met upon a hill. Mother she blew my brain I will go back again.
35,Just like the wind takes the leaf from the tree. You always know how to dismantle me. Yeah you're (?) is making me weak. And it's a comment not a compliment. Just a vacation and apologies. Guess I'm suseptable(spelling?) to more tragedy. Cross your heart but theres not guarentees. It's not fair but whos keeping score?. How many times can a promise be broken?. Who taught you how to love?. Are we on the same side?. We know how to play this game. You fall and then I catch you. And then you kiss me goodnight. Close your eyes and think of me. I wanna be with you. Dreaming the same dream. Why you playing around with me?. Put it away in little compartments. This didn't happen by accident. I've got your back but your so broken. We always come back for more. How many times can a promise be broken?. Who taught you how to love?. Are we on the same side?. We know how to play this game. You fall and then I catch you. And then you kiss me goodnight. Close your eyes and think of me. I wanna be with you. Dreaming the same dream. Why you playing around with me?. Who taught you how to love?. I try and try and try I don't understand and there must be a good reason.. Are we on the same side?. We know how to play this game. You fall and then I catch you. And then you kiss me goodnight. Close your eyes and think of me. I wanna be with you. Dreaming the same dream. Why you playing around with me?. Are we dreaming the same dream?. Why you playing around with me?. Are we dreaming the same dream?
38,(Keith's theme) The beach is a place where a man can feel. He's the only soul in the world that's real. Well I see a face coming through the haze. I remember him from those crazy days.. Ain't you the guy who used to set the paces. Riding up in front of a hundred faces. I don't suppose you would remember me. But I used to follow you back in '63.. I've got a good job. And I'm newly born.. You should see me dressed up in my uniform.. I work in hotel all gilt and flash.. Remember the place where the doors were smashed?. Bell Boy! I got to keep running now.. Bell Boy! Keep my lip buttoned down.. Bell Boy! Carry this baggage out.. Bell Boy! Always running at someone's heel.. You know how I feel always running at someone's heel.. Some nights I still sleep on the beach.. Remember when stars were in reach.. Then I wander in early to work. Spend the day licking boots for my perks.. A beach is a place where a man can feel etc.. People often change. But when I look in your eyes. You could learn a lot from. A job like mine.. The secret to me. Isn't flown like a flag. I carry it behind. This little badge. What says.... Bell Boy!.
39,It was a teenage wedding. and the old folks wished them well. You could see that Pierre did truly love the madamoiselle. And now the young monsieur. and madame have rung the chapel bell. C'est la vie say the old folks. it goes to show you never can tell. They furnished off an apartment. with a two room Roebuck sale. The coolerator was crammed. with Tv dinners and ginger ale. But when Pierre found work. the little money comin' worked out well. C'est la vie say the old folks. it goes to show you never can tell. They had a hi-fi phono boy did they let it blast. Seven hundred little records all rock rhythm and jazz. But when the sun went down. the rapid tempo of the music fell. C'est la vie say the old folks. it goes to show you never can tell. They bought a souped-up jitney 'twas a cherry red '53. They drove it down to Orleans. to celebrate the anniversary. It was there that Pierre. was married to the lovely madamoiselle. C'est la vie say the old folks. it goes to show you never can tell

44,All Mixed Up. Music: Hexum; Lyrics: Hexum/Martinez. You've got to trust your instinct. And let go of regret. You've got to bet on yourself now star. 'Cause that's your best bet. Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said. We come with the funky style. That gets us known for the show. And we'll mix the hip hop reggae if we say it is so. And fuck the naysayers cause they don't mean a thing. 'Cause this is what style we bring. Now it's morning but last night's on my mind. There's something I need to get off my chest. And no matter what may come to shine. The dream will always be mine. All mixed up you don't know what to do. Next thing you turn around and find the person is you. Thought a freak might be the thing. But the first could be the last so just get off your ass. All mixed up you don't know what to do. Next thing you turn around and find the person is you. Thought a freak might be the thing. But you know this will pass so just get off your ass. You've got to trust your instinct and let go of regret. You've got to bet on yourself now star. 'Cause that's your best bet. Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said. Sick sick bit got to have it. Like bustin' in on a session but you got to call it quits. Sick sick bit just can't quit. Fact that you don't even know makes it fully legit. Now it's morning but last night's on my mind. There's something I need to get off my chest. And no matter what will come to shine. The dream will always be mine. You keep me coming. That is a gal that'l kill 'dem stunning. Keep me coming. That is a gal that'l kill 'dem stunning. Keep me coming. That is a gal that'l kill 'dem stunning. Keep me coming. That is a gal that'l kill 'dem stunning. You make me nervous throat dry. My brain is empty don't know why. But I saw you doing something. Which is really truly nothing. But you could bust me out all day. Many moons since first I saw you. Many moons since first we did the do. Many moons since first I saw you. Many moons since first we did the do. And why did I try when I knew it was no and. Why did I try when I saw it was so. But save it for late we should just let it skate. Cause the waiting feel is fine
45,Summer has come and passed. The innocent can never last. Wake me up when September ends. Like my father's come to pass. Seven years has gone so fast. Wake me up when September ends. Here comes the rain again. Falling from the stars. Drenched in my pain again. Becoming who we are. As my memory rests. But never forgets what I lost. Wake me up when September ends. Summer has come and passed. The innocent can never last. Wake me up when September ends. Ring out the bells again. Like we did when spring began. Wake me up when september ends. Here comes the rain again. Falling from the stars. Drenched in my pain again. Becoming who we are. As my memory rests. But never forgets what I lost. Wake me up when september ends. Summer has come and passed. The innocent can never last. Wake me up when September ends. Like my father's come to pass. Twenty years has gone so fast. Wake me up when September ends. Wake me up when September ends. Wake me up when September ends
46,(Van Morrison). Well don't you know. How much I love you. Don't you know. How much I care. It's beyond my comprehension. 'Cos I love you on the square. It's not bound by any definition. It isn't written in the stars. It's not limited like Saturn. Isn't ruled by Mercury or Mars. Oh won't you meet me. In the Indian summer. Where we'll go walking. Down by the weeping willow tree. Won't you meet me. In the Indian summer. We'll go walking to eternity. It's not modelled by convention. It isn't worshipped like the sun. It's not likened unto any other. And it will never come undone. Well don't you know. That my world is so lonely. Just like a freight train in the dawn. That's why I need to. Have and hold you. Just to keep me from going wrong. Oh won't you meet me. In the Indian summer. We'll go walking. By the weeping willow tree. Won't you meet me Lord. In the Indian summer. We'll go walking to eternity. Won't you meet me. In the Indian summer. Well before. Those chilly winds do blow. Won't you meet me. In the Indian summer. Take me way back. To what I know. Oh won't you meet me. In the Indian summer. We'll go walking. By the weeping willow tree. Oh won't you meet me. In the Indian summer. We'll go walking to eternity.
47,Everybody seems to know when he's around. He lifts me up and fades without a sound. Mr. Sun won't you shine?. Mr. Sun won't you shine?. . Why he's here I will never know.

I think my journey's just begun. Do you think he'll mind?. . Shine.... Shine.... Shine.... Shine.... Let it shine....
50,How to kill people?. Is just a matter of putting something inside a head. And I’m not talking about. A thing of steel. that explodes and burns. And drop you instantly to the floor and hurts. Is something crazy that they stuck inside you head. That gives you fear. So you don’t know what you want or who you are. Once you feel it you’re gone. Still exists but already dead. Your turned (into) a living dead

52,Had a dream that we were dead but we pretended that we still lived.. With no regrets we never bled and we took everything life could give. And came up broken empty handed in the end. In the hearts of the blind something you'll never find is a vision of light. With the voice of the dead I'm screaming. I don't know who I am anymore. Not once in life have I been real but I never felt this close before. I've been looking in your window I've been dressing in your clothes. I've been walking dead watching you long enough to know I can't go on.. Had a dream that fire fell from an opening in the sky. Someone warned me of this hell and I spit in his naive eye. And left him crying for my soul he said would die.. In the hearts of the blind something you'll never find is a vision of light. With the voice of the dead I'm screaming. I don't know who I am anymore.. Not once in life have I been real but I've never felt this close before. I've been looking in your window been dressing in your clothes. I've been watching you long enough to know I can't go on.. In the hearts of the blind something you'll never find is a vision of light. With the voice of the dead I'm screaming. I don't know who I am anymore.. Not once in life have I been real but I've never felt this close before. I've been looking in your window been dressing in your clothes. I've been watching you long enough to know I can't go on.. I've been looking in your window I've been dressing in your clothes. I've been walking dead watching you long enough to know I can't go on.
53,Feeling radical in cotton. Purified in my Satin. But the bomb of the season. Is a velvet revolution. I look at the sky. And feel the tears of the prophets crying. I look at the sky and feel the rain. Their reign of tears. Feeling radical in cotton. Purified in my Satin. But the bomb of the season. Is a velvet revolution. All you killers of the children. There's a new commandment. The true divine creator. Wants a velvet revolution. All you killers of the children. There's a new commandment. The true divine creator. Wants a velvet revolution
55,Here comes a peaceful man for the world outside. (For the world outside). What if I said that right and wrong mean the same?. It's insane. The mask of sanity. Stolen from reality. Nothing standing on his way. The end always justifies the means. Magnetic ability. Justifies delinquency. Dominate and humiliate. Performing acts and changing facts to win. You are not the only one. There's no reaction. Where's the point of sanity?. Discharge of aggression. There are no rules to unleash the beast again. Sadistic impulsive nature. A deep-seated rage. Without shame or guilt. Bad reputation. A heartless human being. Just another sociopath. Another human being (Another human being). Blinded by his selfish pride. Mimicking empathy (Empathy). Behind the lies of an actor's life. Faking lack of low self-esteem (Lack of low self-esteem). Confused path through an empty mind. A childhood mystery. You are not the only one. The mask of sanity.

60,My age is three hundred and seventy-two. And I think with the deepest regret. How I used to pick up and voraciously chew. The dear little boys whom I met. I've eaten them raw in their holiday suits. I've eaten them curried with rice. I've eaten them baked in their jackets and boots. And found them exceedingly nice. But now that my jaws are too weak for such fare. I think it exceedingly rude. To do such a thing when I'm quite well aware. Little boys do not like being chewed. And so I contentedly live upon eels. And try to do nothing amiss. And I pass all the time I can spare from my meals. In innocent slumber - like this
62,She wears a long fur coat of mink. Even in the summer time. Everybody knows from the coy little wink. The girl's got a lot on her mind. She's got big thoughts big dreams. And a big brown Mercedes sedan. What I think this girl. She really wants. Is to be in love with a man. She wants to lead the Glamorous Life. She don't need a man's touch. She wants to lead the Glamorous Life. Without love. It ain't much. She saw him standing in the section marked. If you have to ask you can't afford it lingerie. She threw him bread and said make me scream. In the dark what could he say. Boys with small talk and small minds. Really don't impress me in bed. She said I need a man's man baby. Diamonds and furs. Love would only conquer my head. She wants to lead the Glamorous Life. She don't need a man's touch. She wants to lead the Glamorous Life. Without love. It ain't much. They made haste in the brown sedan. They drove to 55 Secret street. They made love and by the seventh wave. She knew she had a problem. She thought real love is real scary. Money only pays the rent. Love is forever. That's all your life. Love is heaven sent. It's glamorous. She wants to lead the Glamorous Life. She don't need a man's touch. She wants to lead the Glamorous Life. Without love. It ain't much. It ain't much. [Instrumental Interlude]. She wants to lead the Glamorous Life. She don't need a man's touch. She wants to lead the Glamorous Life. Without love. It ain't much. It ain't much. Lead the Glamorous Life. She don't need a man's touch. She wants to lead the Glamorous Life. Without love. It ain't much. It ain't much
63,Dream of a day. When the songs that you play. Are blasting through the speakers in your car. And it comes in a flash and you hear the crowd. Screaming out your name for the encore. Living life. life in the fast lane. Not that bad. No one can complain. Who's to say. That we won't keep it real. Hold on tight. don't you dare let go. Now's the time to let the whole world know. You can shine bright but still keep it real. You know you'll be on the road. Selling out the tickets to your show. Where you're from you're still the one. You were before you left to go on tour. Living life. Life in the fast lane. Not that bad. No one can complain. Who's to say. That we won't keep it real. Hold on tight. Don't you dare let go. Now's the time to let the whole world know. You can shine bright but still keep it real. Did you ever think your dream. Would become a reality?. All you did was just believe. Living life. Life in the fast lane. Not that bad. No one can't complain. Who's to say. That we won´t keep it real. Living life. Life in the fast lane. Not that bad. No one can complain. Who´s to say. That we won´t keep it real. Hold on tight. Don't you dare let go. Now's the time to let the whole world know. You can shine bright but still keep it real. Ps: A letra foi retirada do livrinho do CD .
69,It's no use pretending. That I understand. The hide and seek we play with facts. It changes on demand. Tilt my hat at the sun. And the shadows they burn dark. Light me and I'll burn for you. And the love song never stops. I like the look in your eyes. When you talk that certain way. I love the day in the life. When you know that lover's way. Minding my own business. When you came along. Temperature's been running hot. The fever was so strong. It's always an adventure. The fantasies we make a fact. You're the secret I desire. I can't keep that to myself. When we're not together. It doesn't feel so bad. We could be so far apart. But our love's not sad. It's no use pretending. 'Cause I understand. The hide and seek we play with facts.
71,I remember yesterday and I’d sit and watch the hound dogs play. Howlin’ at the china moon. ? ? now yesterday is the busted blues. Life was young things were easy. Days were short nights were warm. Time were good. hate was shallow. ? ? the horse crazy behind the ? ? ? ?. I swear that I’ve seen your face somewhere back in that time. And I’m in theat place. do you remember?. The old house stood like world war two with just rooms. And a hall to be used.. The lady was mean.. Just slightly unclean with a heart of cold silver and gold.. Kitchen smelled of kerosene.. Celing hung down on ? veil? and rotted beams. And the man they said his work could of hung in the room. Now he sits around all day because his left arm won’t move. He was a master of the art of electricity. He lectured on tours and circuitry.. He was self-employed but he could never see his way into the light. He had a room full of switches and dials and lights and. A head full of clouds and eyes full of sight.. And when it got dark. I could hear his heartbeat like a mother in the night.. She stood like a guardian ready to give everything up.. If I had asked for a sword and her blood in a cup.. But there was just time when I asked for too much.. She sighed because she could not give it.. We used to sit beneath the tree just the lady the radio man and me.. And I think it was the winter of ’63 the man went away and let us be. It was early on an august day that the lady decided she must go away.. Her heart it seems could not pay the price for what her body was buying. I came home from school and I found the note went into the kitcken. And lit the old stone with songs set on overload.. I turned on the tv spent the rest of the sfternoon watching. All my cartoons thru the hall. And across the porch was the sun surrendered like a crying torch.
72,Too many people are talking shit. Too many people are telling lies. Nobody ever wants to give an inch. Nobody ever wants to sacrifice.. Sacrifice pay the price understand you gotta lend a hand.. Respect the man live your life like a fucking man.. You walk the globe acting like a fool. But what you're doing comes back to you.. Just remember rule number one. When you're a dick you'll be treated like a dick.. A dick a cock a piece of shit. 'Cause karma has everything to do with it.. It's not where you're going it's where you've been. It's not what you're doing it's what you've done.. That's right you'll never be the little one. Never give in and never say you're done.. Nobody ever wants to sacrifice. Nobody ever gonna pay the price.. Nobody ever gonna understand. Nobody ever gonna lend a hand.. When ya listen to the lyrics it's a conscience song. School your differences on right and wrong.. You teach you learn you gain insight. I'll show you the difference between wrong and right.. One is wrong and one is right.
75,It start at the top. Now it's spiralling down. Works best when it's lost. Diggin' under the ground. Never mind it now. We can bring it back. It's total trash. And it's a natural fact. That I'm not no cow. It's never the same. It's more than a game. Can't take it away. Can't kill all the shame. It's a guilty man. That increased the crack. It's total trash. Sack 'em on the back. With a heavy rock. There he goes again. Magic monkey friend. Can I love the time. That he seems to spend. With all the kids in town. It start at the top. Now it's spiralling down. Works best when it's lost. Diggin' under the ground. Never mind it now. We can bring it back. It's total trash. And it's a natural fact. That I'm not no cow
78,I don't like opera and I don't like ballet. and new wave French movies they just drive me away.

84,"Words by Beth Slater Whitson Music by Leo Friedman. I am dreaming Dear of you day by day. Dreaming when the skies are blue When they're gray;. When the silv'ry moonlight gleams Still I wander on in dreams. In a land of love it seems Just with you.. Let me call you ""Sweetheart"" I'm in love with you.. Let me hear you whisper that you love me too.. Keep the love-light glowing in your eyes so true.. Let me call you ""Sweetheart"" I'm in love with you.. Longing for you all the while More and more;. Longing for the sunny smile I adore;. Birds are singing far and near Roses blooming ev'rywhere. You alone my heart can cheer; You just you.. Let me call you ""Sweetheart"" I'm in love with you..

My heart is breaking.. Walk slow.......

95,"Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon. But God gave me a stage a guitar and a song. My daddy told me ""Son don't you get involved in. Politics religions other peoples' quarrels"". I'll paint the picture let me set the scene. I know when I have children they will know what it means. And I pass on these things my family's given to me. Just love and understanding positivity. We could change this whole world with a piano. Add a bass some guitar grab a beat and away we go. I'm just a boy with a one-man show. No university no degree but lord knows. Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth. And the stock market crashing and their portfolios. While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote. Sing love could change the world in a moment. But what do I know?. Love can change the world in a moment. But what do I know?. Love can change the world in a moment. The revolution's coming it's a minute away. I saw people marching in the streets today. You know we are made up of love and hate. But both of them are balanced on a razor blade. I'll paint the picture let me set the scene. I know I'm all for people following their dreams. Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans. It's love and understanding positivity. We could change this whole world with a piano.

96,It's a sad affair. When there's no one there. He calls out in the night. And it's so unfair. At least it seems that way. When you gave him his life. And all this time he's been getting you down. You ought to pick him up when there's no one around. And convince him. Just talk to him. Cos he knows in his heart you won't be home soon. He's an only child in an only room. And he's dependant on you. And it seems so strange. That at the end of the day. Making love can be so good. But the Pain of birth. What is it worth. When it don't turn out the way it should.
97,"All the children testified that Miss Macbeth. wore a fishbone slide in her cobweb tresses. Her eyes were black like first foot coal clutched as white as chalk-dust. Her fingers sweated india-ink and poison-pen letters. There is a hungry hanging tree just below your bedroom window. You can hear her take a broom to beat out a tattoo on the ceiling. Her bloodless face ran red inside but was she. really evil was she only pantomime. Now the chalk on the wall says that somebody. saves that somebody's face has just been washed off the pavement. Into a puzzle where petrol will be poisoned by rain. Miss Macbeth saw her reflection. As confetti bled it's colours down the drain. Chorus:. And everyday she lives out another love song. It's a tearful lament of somebody done wrong. Well how can you miss what you've never possessed?. Miss Macbeth. Well we all should have known when the children paraded. They portrayed her in their fairytales sprinkling Deadly Nightshade. And as they tormented her she rose to the bait. Even a scapegoat must have someone to hate. And everyday she lives out another love song. ""You're up there enjoying yourself and I know it's wrong"". Well how can you miss what you've never possessed. Miss Macbeth. Sometimes people are just what they appear to be. With no redemption at all. We try to walk upright when we can't even crawl. Miss Macbeth has a gollywog she chucks under. the chin and she whispers to it tenderly Then sticks it on a pin. And It might be coincidence but a boy down. the lane that she said ""went white as he could do"" then doubled over in pain."

99,I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go. I would hate my disappointment to show. There's nothing for me here so I will disappear. If she turns up while I'm gone. please let me know.. I've had a drink or two and I don't care. There's no fun in what I do if she's not there. I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long. I think I'll take a walk and look for her.. Though tonight she's made me sad. I still love her. If I find her I'll be glad. I still love her.. I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go. I would hate my disappointment to show. There's nothing for me here so I will disappear. If she turns up while I'm gone. please let me know.. Though tonight she's made me sad. I still love her. If I find her I'll be glad. I still love her.. I've had a drink or two and I don't care. There's no fun in what I do if she's not there. I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long. I think I'll take a walk and look for her
103,You're sending me tulips mistaken for lilies. You give me your lip after punching me silly. You turned my head till it rolled down the brain drain. If I had any sense now I wouldn't want it back again. New Amsterdam it's become much too much. Till I have the possession of everything she touches. Till I step on the brakes to get out of her clutches. Till I speak double dutch to a real double duchess. Down on the mainspring listen to the tick tock. Clock all the faces that move in on your block. Twice shy and dog tired because you've been bitten. Everything you say now sounds like it was ghost-written. Chorus. Back in London they'll take you to heart after a little while. Though I look right at home I still feel like an exile. Somehow I found myself down at the dockside. Thinking of the old days of Liverpool and Rotherhithe. The transparent people who live on the other side. Living a life that is almost like suicide. Chorus.
104,Not the back of a gentle mother. I do like a manhole cover. It keeps on pounding my head. We'll order water. Torture sauce and economics. Every day just more comics. In a pissing contest. That started out with atomic bombs. Mom will they drop the bomb. Will they think about their children's children. Be a forwardless mess and this. No one to call. You can't make them stall. I want to feed them to each other. Cause I'm sick of them all. How can't you see something's missing. Is anyone listening. We're shooting up flares. Does anyone care. They got this world locked down bound and gagged. From the reds in Pine Ridge to that land in Bagdad. When did our leaders. Become bottom feeders. We're shooting up flares. Does anyone care. They got this world locked down bound and gagged. With constant fear and paranoia toxins in our head. It's just something they know how to do. How to make everyone feel uncalm. The masses just take it while they turn the screws. Bring to a boil add oil then bomb. It's just something that we got to fight. How to make everyone feel uncalm. Keep us distracted with ???. Porno shows MTV hoes and all the radio. It's the same fucking song. That's just the way it goes. Cold turkey world to democracy's girls. From the rules of engagements sweet heart. This is the world. How can so many sit silent. Enough to the violence. We're shooting up flares. Does anyone care. They got this world locked down bound and gagged. The Botox Barbie dolls and magazine ads. It's just something they know how to do. How to make everyone feel uncalm. The masses just take it while they turn the screws. Bring to a boil add oil then bomb. Embodying all that we know to be wrong. How to make everyone feel uncalm. When a war chant becomes a popular song
105,I look out on the city lights. The guarded streets below. I marvel at my history. The things that I don't know. Just another question. A shadow on my soul. Will there be time. Will there be time before I go. I left home in a hurry. Off to see the world. Then I played some music. Then I loved a girl. Someone called me papa. Took my breath away. Would I be fine. Would I be alright with just today. Will there be time enough for me before I go. Love without rules. Love without end. Sending a lofty prayer for peace out on the wind. Breaking the curse. Breaking the chain...... Making a promise I won't have to make again. I look out on the city lights. The stories that they tell. And wonder at my destiny. Beyond this carousel. Such a hollow question. A tether frayed by fear. Will there be time. Time to let go while I'm here. Will there be time enough for me so I'll know. Will there be time enough for me before I go. .

113,Run they said to a promised land. Run and find us a helping hand. Don’t come back till the sun is gone. Don’t come back till the war is won. We all set out with our hearts in hand. A cold wind covered up a line in the sand. All so young. Nothing to lose. Pieces of silver and a dead mans shoes. And oh do you know what I’m saying. Strike a light to guide us. Somewhere. Tempest swells our worlds collide. Arrows from above and the salt in our eyes. Then as the sky began to bruise. We all sought shelter from the breaking news. Oh did I ever show you. All the great memorials all the factory floors. And oh though you know I don’t know you. Now that were here. Let’s make them proud. On and on and on and on and on and on we go. Traipsing over bridges. Over corpses down below. And all the while we could have smiled. For one thing on our minds. The very thing you strive for. Is the thing that makes you blind. Run they said to a promised land. Run and find us a helping hand. Don’t come back till the sun is gone. Don’t come back till the war is won. Tempest high stories tall. Thought that we learnt nothing at all. Then at last the day was saved. With flowers borrowed from a dead friends grave. And oh even still I don’t know you. Maybe I’ll show you. If you’ve eyes to see. And so farewell. And so farewell. And so farewell

145,You told me you don't love me. Over a cup of coffee. And I just have to look away. A million miles between us. Planets crash into dust. I just let it fade away. I'm walking empty streets. Hoping we might meet. I see your car parked on the road. The light on at your window. I know for sure that you're home. But I just have to pass on by. So no of course we can't be friends. Not while I'm still this obsessed. I guess I always knew the score. This is how our story ends. I smoke your brand of cigarettes. And pray that you might give me a call. I lie around on bed all day just staring at the walls. Hanging round bars at night. Wishing I had never been born. And give myself to anyone who wants to take me home. So no of course we can't be friends. Not while I still feel like this. I guess I always knew the score. This is where our story ends. You left behind some clothes. My belly summersaults. When I pick them off the floor. My friends all say they're worried. I'm looking far too skinny. I've stopped returning all their calls. And no of course we can't be friends. Not while I'm still so obsessed. I want to ask where I went wrong. But don't say anything at all. It took a cup of coffee. To prove that you don't love me

Beneath my Christmas tree. 'Cause the best little present. A girl ever had. Has gone away from me. Oh my Christmas tree is not very big. In fact it's kind of small. Honey went he picked 'em out. They always seem so tall. The lights don't seem so bright this year. It's hard for me to see. The smile that made my Christmas bright. Is gone away from me. I have been so lonely. Since you left me all alone. All I want for Christmas is. My baby back at home. oh my Christmas tree's so sad and bare. My room's so big and cold. They wish me happy new year.

See the world through my dirty lonely mixed-up mind."

172,Here on the edge of the moon. Running from our future. As I look back. Your heart grabs my hand. Asking me. To remember a vow you made. That would always take. Me to the edge of the moon. Circling pictures of you. The time you sailed on. Under the diamond eye. Or for a dolphin who for a song had. Crossed night. To bring back your bride. Under a warm tuscan sun. No cliff was too steep for us. Here at the edge of the moon. I surf a curve thrown by you. And did you teach me to fly. Past your marmalade sky. So that after the waning and waxing of love. You could find. Me at the edge. Here at the edge. Me at the edge of. The edge of the moon. Now I'm going back. Past that marmalade sky. 'cause you've got my waxing and waning. As primitive girls. You can stir the embers of the lucy. Inside of my soul. Now I'm going back. Past that marmalade sky. 'cause you've got my waxing and waning. As primitive girls. You can stir the embers of the lucy. Inside of my soul. Now I'm going back. Past that marmalade sky. 'cause you've got my waxing and waning. As primitive girls. You can stir the embers of the lucy inside. The lucy inside. Stir the lucy inside of my soul. Here at the edge. Me at the edge of. The edge of the moon
173,So now I see. How nice it could be. To rocket through the star. Like a fire bullet through the sky. Beautiful sight. Silent and bizarre. Wonder where you are. Rocket like a bullet through the sky. Circling on orbit through the night. Peace of mind - not so far away. Till I find my way back home. So close to me. Reaching out - to learn how good life is. Living in a world like this. So close to me. Our blue marbles just a grain of sand. And the universe is waiting for us there. Out of this world.... Into the darknest night. Hoping that I´m not alone. People are lost on that solid ground. And there´s something I want you to know. We are slowly destroying this world. No other planet. Nowhere is better than here. Into the night. Out of this world. Spinning around the night. Seeing the people so small. I see how much we have screwed our lives. And there´s something I´m trying to say. There´ll be no second chance for our race. Circled horizons. Staring at our lonely world. Into the night. Like a fire bullet through the sky. When I find my way back home

For the things that money can't buy. You better start savin' up. For the things that money can't buy. You better start. You need a strong man baby. To love and understand you. A man who ain't afraid sugar. To get some dirt on his hands for you. And when you're feeling so down-hearted. And all you wanna do is cry. Ah just come on take my hand baby. Together you and I. We could start savin' up. For the things that money can't buy. We'd better start savin' up. For the things that money can't buy. You better start savin' up. For the things that money can't buy. You better start savin' up. For the things that money can't buy.

178,M. Jagger/K. Richards). Sittin' in my bedroom late last night. Got into bed and turned out the light. Decided to call my baby on the telephone. All I got was an engaged tone. It's off the hook. It's off the hook. It's off the hook. It's off the hook. It's off the hook. Talkin' so long she upset my mind. Why is she talkin' such a long time?. Maybe she's sleeping maybe she's ill. Phone's disconnected unpaid bill. It's off the hook. It's off the hook. It's off the hook. It's off the hook. It's off the hook. Don't wanna see her afraid of what I'd find. Tired of letting her upset me all the time. Back into bed started reading my books. Take my phone right off of the hook. It's off the hook. It's off the hook. It's off the hook. It's off the hook. It's off the hook. It's off the hook. (repeat and fade).
179,I start up in the north I grow from special seed. I sprinkle it with sensibility. From French and Hungarian snow. I linger in the sprouting until my engine’s full. Then I move across the sea. To European bliss. To language of poets. As I cut the cord of home. I kiss my mother’s mother. Look to the horizon. Wide eyed new ground. Humbled by my new surroundings. I am a citizen of the planet. My president is kwan yin. My frontier is on an airplane. My prisons: homes for rehabilitating. Then I fly back to my nest I fly back with my nuclear but everything is different. So I wait my yearn for home is broadened patriotism expanded by calling from beyond. So I pack my things nothing precious all things sacred. I am a citizen of the planet. My laws are all of attraction. My punishments are consequences. Separating from source the original sin. I am citizen of the planet. Democracy’s kids are sovereign. Where the teachers are the sages. And pedestals fill with every parent. And so the next few years are blurry the next decades’ a flurry of. smells and tastes unknown. Threads sewn straight through this fabric through fields of every. color one culture to another. I come alive and I get giddy I am taken and globally naturalized. I am a citizen of the planet. From simple roots through high vision. I am guarded by the angels. My body guides the direction I go in. I am a citizen of the planet. My favorite pastime edge stretching. Besotten with human condition. These ideals are borne from my deepest within
180,Gonna build it up just to burn it down. You're a princess I'm a fucking clown. Stop the presses cause I'm killing time. Won't you be my bloody valentine. You're just a fucking kid. And no one ever gives you a break. You want a senorita. And now your heart is gonna break. You're angel blue. With teenage traces. Angel blue. With pretty faces. Stab my heart like a stick in the mud. Cut my chest just to see the blood. Now I'm singing out the alphabet. Averages of putting about my cigarette. We're at the cemetary so we can see the holiday lights. Waking up the dead and everything'll be alright. You're angel blue. With teenage traces. Angel blue. With pretty faces. Alright. Stuck in the middle of Heaven and Hell. Alright. Trying to find my better angels. Stab my heart like a stick in the mud. Cut my chest just to see the blood. Stop the presses cause I'm killing time. Won't you be my bloody valentine. You're just a fucking kid. And no one ever gives you a break. You want a senorita. And now your heart is gonna break. You're angel blue. With teenage traces. Angel blue. With pretty faces. Crédito: Equipe Green Day Eulogy
185,There's a flame that leads our souls astray. No one's safe from its tender touch of pain. And every day it's looking for new slaves. To celebrate the beauty of the grave. We are like the living dead. Sacrificing all we have. For a frozen heart and a soul on fire. We are like the living dead. Craving for deliverance. With a frozen heart and a soul on fire. And again we're falling for disgrace. And hate will shelter us from the rain. We are enslaved by the sacred heart of shame. And gently raped by the light of day. We are like the living dead. Sacrificing all we have. For a frozen heart and a soul on fire. We are like the living dead. Craving for deliverance. With a frozen heart and a soul on fire. Addicted to our divine despair. The venom of the cross we bear. The guilt will follow us to death. We are like the living dead. Sacrificing all we have. For a frozen heart and a soul on fire. We are like the living dead. Craving for deliverance. With a frozen heart and a soul on fire. With a soul on fire. Soul on. Soul on. Fire. Soul on fire

(Do you feel the same). Adolescence. Just can't make sense. (It's calling my name). I take a look around. And all the things I've found. I call it blind hatred. If you'd stop a while. And maybe if you'd smile. You would realize that. We're all the same. It's just like our brain. When it goes insane. We feel the same pain. All my life I've seemed to have this need. I think at times it even turns to greed. We all want to join some family. We'll even sacrifice a moral changing
194,I've worked in this factory far too long. Can't remember when I last had. Some time to breathe and be on my own. And to do things just for a laugh. To be a clown to paint the town.

There are 5 more days 'til summer. 5 more days 'til summer. 5 more days 'til summer. Takes me away. I work on the night shift until the dawn. My whole life has been in the dark.

229,She comes out on Fridays every time. Stands out in a line. I could have been anyone she'd seen. She waits another week to fall apart. She couldn't make another day. I wish it was anyone but me. I could have been anyone you see. She had something breakable just under her skin. American girls are weather and noise. Playing the changes for all of the boys. Holding a candle right up to my hands. Making me feel so incredible. She comes out of closets every night. But then she locks herself away. Where she could keep everything from me. I could have been anyone you see. She's nothing but porcelain underneath her skin. American girls are weather and noise. Playing the changes for all of the boys. Holding a candle right up to my hand. Making me feel so incredible. Little shiver shaking me everyday. But I could get this same thing anywhere. So if she goes away. Well it's alright and I'm ok. Hey she said come back again tonight. And I said I might I might I might. She said well that's alright. If it's alright it's alright with you. If it's alright if it's alright with me. I waited for an hour last Friday night. She never came around. She took almost everything from me. I'm going through my closets. Trying on her clothes almost everyday. I could have been anyone you see. I wish it was anyone but me. Nothing but pills and ashes under my skin. American girls are weather and noise. Playing the changes for all of the boys. Holding a candle right up to my hand. Making me feel so incredible. If I make you cry you tell me why. I'll try again if you'll let me try. American girls are feathers and cream. Coming to bed so edible. American girls oh. American girls. American girls. Oh oh oh oh. American girls oh. American girls. American girls. Oh oh oh oh. You made me cry. You made me cry. You made me cry. Yeah you made me cry. You made me cry. Hey Miss American Girl. Oh oh oh yeah
232,It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding) ( Bob Dylan ). Darkness at the break of. noon. Shadows even the silver. spoon. The handmade blade the. child's balloon. Eclipses both the sun and. moon. To understand you know. too soon. There is no sense in. trying.. Pointed threats they. bluff with scorn. Suicide remarks are torn. From the fool's gold. mouthpiece. The hollow horn plays. wasted words. Proves to warn. That he not busy being. born. Is busy dying.. Temptation's page flies. out the door. You follow find yourself. at war. Watch waterfalls of pity. roar. You feel to moan but. unlike before. You discover. That you'd just be. One more person crying.. So don't fear if you hear. A foreign sound to your. ear. It's alright Ma I'm. only sighing.. As some warn victory. some downfall. Private reasons great or. small. Can be seen in the eyes. of those that call. To make all that should. be killed to crawl. While others say don't. hate nothing at all. Except hatred.. Disillusioned words like. bullets bark. As human gods aim for. their mark. Made everything from toy. guns that spark. To flesh-colored Christs. that glow in the dark. It's easy to see without. looking too far. That not much. Is really sacred.. While preachers preach of. evil fates. Teachers teach that. knowledge waits. Can lead to. Goodness hides behind its. gates. But even the president of. the United States. Sometimes must have. To stand naked.. An' though the rules of. the road have been lodged. It's only people's games. that you got to dodge. And it's alright Ma I. can make it.. Advertising signs that. con you. Into thinking you're the. one. That can do what's never. been done. That can win what's never. been won. Meantime life outside. goes on. All around you.. You lose yourself you. reappear. You suddenly find you got. nothing to fear. Alone you stand with. nobody near. When a trembling distant. voice unclear. Startles your sleeping. ears to hear. That somebody thinks. They really found you.. A question in your nerves. is lit. Yet you know there is no. answer fit to satisfy. Insure you not to quit. To keep it in your mind. and not forget. That it is not he or she. or them or it. That you belong to.. Although the masters make. the rules. For the wise men and the. fools. I got nothing Ma to. live up to.. For them that must obey. authority. That they do not respect. in any degree. Who despise their jobs. their destinies. Speak jealously of them. that are free. to be. Nothing more than. something. They invest in.. While some on principles. baptized. To strict party platform. ties. Social clubs in drag. Outsiders they can freely. criticize. Tell nothing except who. to idolize. And then say God bless. him.. While one who sings with. his tongue on fire. Gargles in the rat race. choir. Bent out of shape from. society's pliers. Cares not to come up any. higher. But rather get you down. in the hole. That he's in.. But I mean no harm nor. put fault. On anyone that lives in a. vault. But it's alright Ma if. I can't please him.. Old lady judges watch. people in pairs. Limited in sex they dare. To push fake morals. insult and stare. While money doesn't talk. it swears. Obscenity who really. cares Propaganda all is. phony.. While them that defend. what they cannot see. With a killer's pride. security. It blows the minds most. bitterly. For them that think. death's honesty. Won't fall upon them. naturally. Life sometimes. Must get lonely.. My eyes collide head-on. with stuffed graveyards. False gods I scuff. At pettiness which plays. so rough. Walk upside-down inside. handcuffs. Kick my legs to crash it. off. Say okay I have had. enough. What else can you show. me?. And if my thought-dreams. could be seen. They'd probably put my. head in a guillotine. But it's alright Ma. it's life and life only.. . Copyright © 1965. Special Rider Music. [Columbia Records]

237,A little girl up on a ledge. Lookin down from on top of the world. Ready to take a step into waiting arms. To hold her as her body falls. There's a little girl lost. Somewhere on top of the world. She wants to lay her head on a pillow of clouds. And pull a blanket of sky over her head. The world spinnin and crashin into her all the time. But this time (it's her instead). Standin on the edge. Lookin down from on top of the world. SOLO 1. She says goodbye to all the beautiful things. And closes her eyes and listens. To the water passing under the bridge - reminds her. Of the whisper of a man she was once missin'. Only in the past will time forever last. And she's gonna fly (Dweezil now say goodbye...). SOLO 2 (Dweezil). Little girl up on a ledge. Lookin down from on top of the world. She steps forward. And her breath connects to the sky as her body curls. She smiles as all wishes are granted - to fly. Like she does in that recurring dream.. Free.. Collision.. Shock.. She shatters opens becomes the river.. But for a moment she was on top of the world.. She ends.. Like a song we end.
239,I gave her no reason. To leave me all alone. Now all the seasons. Come by and swear as we go. And the life I’m leading here. Just ain't the same without her. The summer rain has turned to snow. Sunshine showers warm her heart today. Sprinkle sunlight in her eyes and tell her. Tell her to come back some sunny day. I remember those little games. Of love we used to play. Like innocent children. We loved and laughed the time away. Now I’m holding on to a dream. It can't be the same without her. A broken heart can turn to clay. Sunshine showers warm her heart today. Sprinkle sunlight in her eyes and tell her. Tell her to come back some sunny day. Sunshine showers warm her heart today. Sprinkle sunlight in her eyes and tell her. Tell her to come back some sunny day
241,I believe in prophecy. Some folks see things not everybody can see. And once in a while they pass. The secret along to you and me. And I believe in miracles. Something sacred burning in every bush and tree. We can all learn to sing the songs the angels sing. Yeah I believe in God and God ain't me. I've traveled around the world. Stood on mighty mountains and gazed across the wilderness. Never seen a line in the sand or a diamond in the dust. And as our fate unfurls. Every day that passes I'm sure about a little bit less. Even my money keeps telling me it's God I need to trust. And I believe in God but God ain't us. God in my little understanding don't care what name I call. Whether or not I believe doesn't matter at all. I receive the blessings. That every day on earth's another chance to get it right. Let this little light of mine shine and rage against the night. Just another lesson. Maybe someone's watching and wondering what I got. Maybe this is why I'm here on earth and maybe not. But I believe in God and God is God

258,I see shadow and light. Stroking the mist. And I hear voices take flight. And send out our wish. Of peaceful dreams on a night. Moonlight kissed. Tendrils of smoke lash the street. And shamelessly court. Disguised honey sweet. To cater all sorts. And hushed tones all agree. And the world distorts. Wishing on a speck of dust. In this crazy ocean of fate. An echo of a memory. And maybe just a little too late. Fingers of blue on the snow. Reaching to touch. The warm light still aglow. Across the porch. We watch the scene die untold. Outside our window. For my words are the salt of lust. On that ivory skin. Difficult to hear at all. Through the everyday din. What is this if not some witchcraft?. Wrapped up widdershins. To lead us all astray. Hook in mouth. On through such webs of lies. Truth's a distant star. In our eyes. Moonlight kissed. New day comes again. And it laughs in your face. Whispering secrets of pain. By all its names. What flame could burn out the stain. Of a life misplaced?. But summer's scent still lingers. In your hair. Despite the ache. There's magic everywhere. Out the window run rebellion. Rapt with all you find. For seeking something new. Play in the ponds like summer's wind. Dance with the trees melding with mist. Beyond their flower field like. You're moonlight kissed
259,We live in a cold dark world with venom in it's fangs. You can spit it in my face but I know I'll be ok. It's on the attack. It's a war It's a game. A ball and chain chew my arm off to get away. Don't fight or it deny it invite it cause when it. Feels like a kick in the teeth I can take it. Throw your stones and you won't see me break it. Say what you want take your shots. You're setting me free with one more kick in the teeth. (Na na na na na). Kick in the Teeth (na na na na na na). I gotta say thanks cause you kick me when I'm down. I'm bleeding out the mouth. I hope you know I'm stronger now. I'm taking the hate I'm turning it all around. I won't go down 'til I'm six feet underground. Don't fight or it deny it invite it cause when it. Feels like a kick in the teeth I can take it. Throw your stones and you won't see me break it. Say what you want take your shots. You're setting me free with one more kick in the teeth. (na na na na na). Kick in the teeth (na na na na na). What doesn't kill me only. Will make me stronger in my head. In my head. Cause when it. Feels like a kick in the teeth I can take it.

260,Teach me to fold. And I'll teach you to sing. When life keeps stealing your melody. Around your finger I'll be a string. I will forget everything I know. About love I don't know about love. It sure feels good at first. I'll learn to dance if you promise not to laugh. And I end up in a cast from falling over. And you can't get mad. When some girl you think I had. Puts a story in your head. When I hardly know her so. About love I don't know about love. It sure feels good at first. Oh every spring needs a honey bee that stings. So things can't change. Oh every fire get too close and it reminds you. So Things can change in love. But it sure feels good at first. For every heartbreak there's a sermon to be said. And this pastor in my head is preaching to the choir. Donthe crow't get me wrong cause it's too soon to decide. But the same in my first rodeo. When my heart spin broke and tired. In love I don't know about love. But it sure feels good at first. Oh every autumn colors come that you forgotten. So things can't change. Oh every frost some live on and some are lost. So Things can change in love. But it sure feels good at first. But it sure felt good at first
263,When you hear that rooster crowing. In the dawn in the dawn. There's really no way of knowing. What goes on what goes on. The world is full of questions. Some are answered some are not. The only faith you're keepin'. Is the faith that you still got. I love the sound of laughter. And music in the air. And in the Ever After. I know it's always there. A man had many boxes. And he liked them quite a lot. But they would not be opened. 'Cause the value would be shot. Sometimes when I go walkin'. In the trees in the trees. That's where I do my prayin'. In the trees in the trees. The world is full of answers. Some are right some are wrong. The one that I believe in is a wish in a song. I love to see you smilin'. And hear your voice so fair. And in the Ever After. I know you're always there

269,The story is a famous one. Now worshipped now dismissed. Rehearsed and trawled for meanings. That may well not exist. The demon at the story's heart. The cuckoo in the nest. Gives little of himself away. Which is of course why you will stay. In case he falters should betray. By whom or what possessed. These are the facts of the matter. These are the names in the case. This is the story the passion. The time and the place. They're laid here before you. So judge if you can -. The devil incarnate or. A misunderstood man?. His origins his way of life. His motives - they're all news. No shortage of detractors. To air their noisy views. The man inspires a thousand lies. The lover takes his choise. Remaining coldly in control. Aware that sadly on the whole. It is the fool who bares his soul. I'll give the man a voice!. These are the facts of the matter. These are the names in the case. This is the story the passion. The time and the place. They're laid here before you. So judge if you can -. The devil incarnate or. A misunderstood man?
272,Tired of being seen as a bird in a cage. Tired of being heard all he did last week. Obviously you want to beat me â€˜cause everytime. when I fall youâ€™re the first to reveal me. Live for yourself instead. Do me a favour. Feed your empty head. You drive me close to the edge. Everything you say you say to annoy me. Watching every move I make whenever Iâ€™m around. Everything you do you do it to destroy me. Waiting for the darkest hour to put me down. Time is gradual the surface is all you can see. And if I told you the truth you might understand me. Feed your empty head. Do me a favour. Live for yourself instead. You drive me close to the edge. Everything you say you say to annoy me. Watching every move I make whenever Iâ€™m around. Everything you do you do it to destroy me. Waiting for the darkest hour to put me down. You drive me close to the edge.

279,I know the stories. Of undersea lights. It all seems so clear to me. From this astounding aerial view. I start to wonder. More about you. And your dreams. I'll follow each step you take. As I want to know your secrets too. Under the shelter of this evening sky. We can dream further than we ever thought aloud. It's always more simple than it seems. Tell me your story and I'll tell you mine. You'll find no more boundaries when you realize that love. Can overpower everything. Tell me your secret and I'll tell you mine. With every word you'll see there's no more need to hide. Our love can overpower everything. I know the secret of the stars with all their beauty and all their light. They just want to feel what we feel. Tell me your story and I'll tell you mine. Tell me your secret and I'll tell you mine
281,As so with that I thought I'd take a final walk. The tide of public opinion had started to abate. The neighbours bless them had turned out to be all talk. I could see their frightened faces peering at me through the gate. I was looking for an end to this for some kind of closure. Time moved so rapidly I had no hope of keeping track of it. I thought of my friends who had died of exposure. And I remembered other ones who had died from the lack of it. And in my best shoes I started falling forward down the street. I stopped at a church and jostled through the crowd. And love followed just behind me panting at my feet. As the steeple tore the stomach from a lonely little cloud. Inside I sat seeking the presence of a God. I searched through the pictures in a leather-bound book. I found a woolly lamb dozing in an issue of blood. And a gilled Jesus shivering on a fisherman's hook. Babe. It seems so long. Since you've been gone away. And I. Just got to say. That it grows darker with the day. Back on the street I saw a great big smiling sun. It was a Good day and an Evil day and all was bright and new. And it seemed to me that most destruction was being done. By those who could not choose between the two. Amateurs dilettantes hacks cowboys clones. The streets groan with little Caesars Napoleons and cunts. With their building blocks and their tiny plastic phones. Counting on their fingers with crumbs down their fronts. I passed by your garden saw you with your flowers. The Magnolias Camellias and Azaleas so sweet. And I stood there invisible in the panicking crowds. You looked so beautiful in the rising heat. I smell smoke see little fires bursting on the lawns. People carry on regardless listening to their hands. Great cracks appear in the pavement the earth yawns. Bored and disgusted to do us down. Babe. It seems so long. Since you've been gone. And I. Just got to say. That it grows darker with the day. These streets are frozen now. I come and go. Full of a longing for something I do not know. My father sits slumped in the deepening snow. As I search in and out above about below. Babe. It seems so long. Since you went away. And I. Just got to Say. That it grows darker with the day
282,We drive in silence beneath the grey dawning skies. Past the cooling towers where the white clouds slowly rise. I watch the world through motionless eyes. Nothing touches . nothing ever touches. Raised as son of Empire hardened like a piece of steel. I am the master now of all that I can see. This means so much to you but nothing much to me. Nothing touches . nothing ever touches. Please take me home - I am very young. Please take me home.. And yes I heard you screaming as you walked out of my door. And yes I've seen those bloody faces picked up from the floor. I feel nothing and yet I understand it all.
283,"played live in 1989. Mr. Trouble never hangs around. When he hears this mighty sound.... ""Here I come to save the day!"". That means that Mighty Mouse is on the way.. Yessir when there is a wrong to right. Mighty Mouse will join the fight. On the sea or on the land. He gets the situation well in hand. So though we are in danger. We never despair.

Love inspires us and empowers us to do great things. And makes us a better person to love. Love makes us feel safe and bring. Us to closer to God. When you go beyond that's where. You find true love. Keep singing singing takes you beyond beyond beyond beyond

325,If I could hold on to just one thought. For long enough to know. Why my mind is moving so fast. And the conversation is slow.. Burn off all the fog. And let the sun through to the snow. Let me see your face again. Before I have to go.. I have seen you in the movies. And in those magazines at night. I saw you on the barstool when. You held that glass so tight.. And I saw you in my nightmares. But I'll see you in my dreams. And I might live a thousand years. Before I know what that means.. Once there was a friend of mine. Who died a thousand deaths. His life was filled with parasites. And countless idle threats.. He trusted in a woman. And on her he made his bets. Once there was a friend of mine.
329,TAXI DANCING. I think that it's high time we had a talk. I think that we're making a big mistake. I've been feeling lately the magic is gone. Are we just together for convenience sake baby. I don't believe it (feeling). I don't think that's true (tied down). It'll just pass if we allow it to (need to break free). It's just a stage we're going through (they say clean cuts). I think you're just restless for something new (heal much faster). Baby feeling like we pay our dime. And all we get in return. Is a piece of each other's time. Are we just Taxi Dancing. Lost somewhere in a slow dance for two. And the band that was playing. Has finally stopped playing our favorite song. Are we just Taxi Dancing. You're paying for me and I'm paying for you. And are we holding on to a feeling with desperation. Don't know if you're right. Don't know if you're wrong. Seems to me we haven't danced for long. Don't make it hard (I won't). Don't make it easy (hold you). We'll just walk away (if you). At the end of the song (must go). Baby put one last nickel in the jukebox. Give that love we once felt. Just one final spin around. 'Cause we're just Taxi Dancing. Lost somewhere in a slow dance for two. And the band that was playing. Has finally stopped playing our favorite song. And we're just dancing. And the band that was playing. Has finally stopped playing our favorite song. Are we just Taxi Dancing. You're paying for me and I'm paying for you. And are we holding on to each other in desperation. Taxi Dancing
330,This is the story of the Liberty of Norton Folgate. Old Jack Norris 'The Musical Shrimp'. And the cadging ramble. A little bit of this. Would you like a bit of that?. But in weather like this. You should wear a coat a nice warm hat. A needle and thread. The hand stitches of time. Battling Lavinski versus Jackie Burke. Bobbing and weaving an invisible line. So step for step and both light on our feet. We'll travel many a long dim silent street. Would you like a bit of this. Or a little bit of that missus. A little bit of what you like does you no harm. You know that. The perpetual steady echo of the passing beat. A continual dark river of people. In their transience and in its permanence. But when the streetlamp fills the gutter with gold. So many priceless items bought and sold. So step for step and both light on our feet. We'll travel many a long dim silent street - together. Once round Arnold Circus. Up through Petticoat Lane. Past The Well of Shadows. And once back round again. Arm in arm with an abstracted air to where. The people stared at the upstairs windows. Because we are living like kings. And these days will last forever. Cos sailors from Africa China and the Archipelago of Malay. Jump ship ragged and penniless into Shadwell's Tiger Bay. The Welsh and Irish Wagtails - mothers of midnight. The music hall carousal is spilling out into bonfire light. Sending half crazed shadows giants. Dancing up the brick wall. Of Mr. Truman's beer factory. Waving bottles ten feet tall. Whether one calls it Spitalfields Whitechapel. Tower Hamlets or Bangle Town. We're all dancing in the moonlight. We're all on borrowed ground. Oh I'm just walking down to. I'm just floating down through. Won't you come with me?. To the Liberty of Norton Folgate. But wait what's that. Dan Leno and a Lime house Gollum. Purposefully walking nowhere. Oh I'm happy just floating about (have a banana). On a Sunday afternoon. The stall holders all call and shout (to no-one in particular). Avoiding people you know. You're just basking in your own company. The Technicolor worlds going by. But you're the lead in your own movie. Cos in the Liberty of Norton Folgate. Walking wild and free. In your second hand coat. Happy just to float. In this little taste of liberty. A part of everything you see. There coming left or right. Trying to flog you stuff you don't need or want. And a smiling chap takes your hand and drags you. In his uncles restaurant (here here here here). There's a Chinese man trying hard to flog you moody DVDs. You know you've seen the film its black and white it's got no sound. And a man's head pops up and down right across you wide screen TV. Only a fiver (how much?). Alright two for eight quid. (‘Ere y'ar look look I'm giving it away). Cos in the Liberty of Norton Folgate. Walking wild and free. In your second hand coat. Happy just to float. In this little piece of liberty. You're a part of everything you see. Cos it's steady old fellows pickpockets. dandies extortioners and night wanderers. The feeble the ghastly upon whom death had placed a very sure hand. Some in shreds and patches. reeling inarticulate full of noisy and inordinate vivacity. Which jars discordantly upon the ear and. give an aching sensation to both pair of eyeballs. (noisy and inordinate vivacity). In the beginning I'd the fear of the immigrant. In the beginning was the fear of the immigrant. He's made his way down to the dark riverside. In the beginning was the fear of the immigrant. In the beginning was the fear of the immigrant. He made his home there by the dark riverside. He made his home there down by the riverside. They made their homes there down by the riverside. The city sprang from the dark river Thames. They made their home there down by the riverside. They made their homes there down by the riverside. The city sprang up from the dark mud of the Thames. I say it again. Cos in the Liberty of Norton Folgate. Walking wild and free. And in your second hand coat. Happy just to float. In this little taste of liberty. Cos you're a part of everything you see. Yes you're a part of everything you see. With a little bit of this. And a little bit of that. A little bit of what you like does you no harm. You know that
331,You’re so sweet. Your smile. Your pussy. And your bones. You’re on fire. You move me. Like music. With your style. Let me think (and you think about what?) about girls. (And what else?) and money and new clothes. (And what do I get?) thirty nights (uh huh). Of violence (yeah) and sugar to love. Come here come here. closer to the lung. So I can I can. Shove her over railing. You’re sweet. but I’m tired. Of proving. This love. See you’re a bore. But you move me. Like a movie. That you love. Let me think (and you think about what?) about girls. (And what else?) and money and new clothes. (And what do I get?) thirty nights (uh huh). Of violence (yeah) and sugar to love. Come here come here. closer to the lung. So I can I can. Shove her over railing. Let me think (and you think about what?) about girls. (And what else?) and money and new clothes. (And what do I get?) thirty nights (uh huh). Of violence (yeah) and sugar to love. Come here come here. closer to the lung. Come here come here. closer to the lung. So I can I can. Shove her over railing.
332,People tell us that we play to loud. But they don't know what our music's about. We never listen to the record company man. They try to screw us and ruin our band.. That's why we don't wanna be good. That's why we don't wanna be good. We're prisoners of rock and roll.. When were jammin' in our old garage. The girls come over and it sure gets hot. We don't wanna be watered down. Takin' orders from record company clowns.. That's why we don't wanna be good. That's why we don't wanna be good. We're prisoners of rock and roll.
333,(Jon Anderson). Long distance runaround. Long time waiting to feel the sound. I still remember the dream there. I still remember the time you said goodbye. Did we really tell lies. Letting in the sunshine. Did we really count to one hundred. Cold summer listening. Hot colour melting the anger to stone. I still remember the dream there. I still remember the time you said goodbye. Did we really tell lies. Letting in the sunshine. Did we really count to one hundred. (REPEAT VERSES). Looking for the sunshine
334,I am gone I am gone. Occasionally we leave to get us back. We're gone but haven't found what's ours yet. I am lost I am lost. Secretly the lost that sets us free. Brings you down to what you really need. It's not that I want to. It's not that I need to. It's not that I long to fall. I don't - want to know. For good - don't wanna rob your goods. I really don't mind to value it. I took - what was my own. Look - I really don't fly to unsacred grounds. To - survey your world. But tell me haven't you heard. Now I'm here now I'm here. Your tainted cry now scattered falls apart. The fear has proven now where you are. I won't give in won't give in. So desperately we boil our ego's none. They quiet us down to sing rattle and hum. It's not that we want to. It's not that we need to. It's not that we long to fall. I don't - want to know. For good - the wonder of your goods. I really don't mind to value it. I took - what was my own. Look - I really don't fly to unsacred grounds. To - survey your world. But tell me haven't you heard. Here I go again here we come again. You won't carry that weight alone on you. You knew the sense of my flight I sense all your fights. There's really no peace for coming in.. I don't - want to know. For good - don't wanna rob your goods. I really don't mind to value it. I took - what was my own. Look - I really don't fly to unsacred grounds. To - survey your world. But tell me haven't you heard
335,Sink me into this tangled web I weave. Deep sleep where we are safe where we are free. Why should I wait when there's so much at stake. I'd lose the fight open my eyes. Cause this is something bigger than we both know bigger than we both know. We've got the space in our hearts for something bigger. But you don't show. Deny me. But you know. I will be nothing without your love. I will be nothing without your love. I will be nothing without your love. Love. I'm thinking about the way my mind translates songs. Turns them into feelings and then makes them into these thoughts. Where you surround me shimmering around me. Maybe it's your energy either way it's astounding. I wanna live in you heart and mind. Technically everything. So Imma keep my lid shut. Time like the lines are red in between time. Time and again my hearts asking me. Why should I wait when there's so much at stake. I'd lose the fight open my eyes. Cause this is something bigger than we both know bigger than we both know. We've got the space in our hearts for something bigger. But you don't show. Deny me. But you know. I will be nothing without your love. I will be nothing without your love. I will be nothing without your love. Love. Magnetic since I met ya. Can't make up potential. And you too pretty too so you're gonna. Run with me through my city. I could take you with me. Anywhere anywhere anywhere. I will be nothing without your love. Without your love. I will be nothing without your love. I will be nothing without your love. I will be nothing without your love. I will be nothing without your love

358,I see you from the sky. And I wonder how long it will take me to get home. I wait for an hour or so at the carousel. I have a cigarette to pass the time. Cause the traffic's hell. I don't want anything more. Than to see your face when you open the door. You'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of tea. And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV. Tomorrow we'll take the dog for a walk. And in the afternoon then maybe we'll talk. I'll be exhausted so I'll probably sleep. And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV. You wipe the tears from my eye.

But I'll send you a postcard when I get there. I don't want anything more. Than to see your face when you open the door. You'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of tea. And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV. Tomorrow we'll take the dog for a walk. And in the afternoon then maybe we'll talk. I'll be exhausted so I'll probably sleep.

363,I found America hiding in the corner of my wallet. It's a well kept secret thought that I had better swallow it. Before they make me spit out the truth. Before they find you're lying about your youth. B movie that's all you are to me. Just a soft soap story. Don't want the woman to adore me. You can't stand it when it goes from real to reel. Too real too real. You can't stand it when I throw punch lines you can feel. All the time there's a rule book in Brittania. That no one ever waives. And everybody's on the make. It's not your heart I want to break. Turn out the lights. I'm thinking that I want to go to sleep now. Just give me a promise that I'm supposed to keep now. I don't want some fool asking me why. When I find you're finally making me cry.

That runs through all my veins. And helps me to hold on. It was a long night. We ran along into the spotlight. You sang a song that made the children cry. And all the people knew my name. It was a bright light. These lands combine into a great big mass. We sang along to the very last. Oh the jury stole my fame. And then we grabbed the sun. And it shined into these eyes. Believe me. Cover up rain down. We wept on the edge of this town. It's all I want it's all we want tonight. I feel it. Cover up rain down. We wept on the edge of this town. It's all I want it's all we want tonight. Oh you look so alive. D-d-d-did you think that we'd cry tonight. Oh did you think we'd cry. Oh can you feel my heart. I think I feel it too.

We wept on the edge of this town. It's all I want it's all we want tonight

393,"The moltitude assembled and tried to make the noise. The black blind poet generals. and restless loud white boys. But time grew thin and the axis. Was left somehow incomplete. Where instead of child lions. We found aging junkie sheep. How many wasted have I seen signed ""Hollywood or bust"". Left to ride them ever ghostly Arizona gusts. Oh cheerleader tramps and kids with big amps. Sounding in the void. High society vamps and ex-heavyweight champs. Mistaking soot for soil. So break me now Big Mama. As Old Faithful breaks the day. Believe me my good Linda. The aurora will shine your way. The Confederacy she's in my name now. And the hounds are held at bay. The axis needs a stronger arm. Do you feel your muscles play?. The doorstep blanket weaver. Madonna she's pushing bells. From house to house to house to house. Giving last kisses and wishing well. To every gypsy mystic and all star hero. That the kids might find the place. Who've been lost forever to papa and mama. On their weekends out in space. Now the sons they search for fathers. But their fathers have all gone. The lost souls search for saviors. But saviours don't last long. Those aimless questionless renegade brats. Who live their lives in songs. They run the length of a candle. In a goodnight whisper and a puff they're gone. So break me now Big Mama. As Old Faithful breaks the day. Believe me my good Linda. The aurora will shine your way. The Confederacy she's in my name now. And the hounds are held at bay. The axis needs a stronger arm. Do you feel your muscles play?. The missions are filled with hermits looking for a friend. The terraces are filled with cat-men looking for a way in. There are orphans junked on silver mountains. Lost in celestial alleyways. They wait for that old tramp Dog Man Moses. He takes in all the strays. ""Now don't grow on empty legends. or lonely cradle songs. 'Cause Billy The Kid was just a bowery boy. Who made his living twirling his guns"". The night she's long she's lanky. She speaks in her mother tongue. And lullabies the refugees. With an amplifier's hum. So break us now Big Mama. As Old Faithful breaks the day. Believe me my sweet Linda. Oh help is sure on the way. The Confederacy she's in my name now. And the hounds are held at bay. The axis needs a stronger arm. Do you feel your muscles play?. The Confederacy she's in my name now. And the hounds are held at bay. The axis needs a stronger arm. Do you feel your muscles play?."

395,I was raised in the valley there was shadows and death.. Got out alive but with scars I can't forget.. This kid back in school subdued and shy.. An orphan and a brother and unseen by most eyes.. I don't know what it was that made a piece of him die. Took a boy to the forest slaughtered him with a scythe.. Stamped on his face an impression in the dirt.. Do you think the silence makes a good man convert?. We all have our horrors and our demons to fight.. But how can I win when I'm paralyzed?. They crawl up on my bed. wrap their fingers round my throat.. Is this what I get for the choices that I made?. God forgive me for all my sins.. God forgive me for everything.. God forgive me for all my sins.. God forgive me God forgive me.. Don't go I can't do this on my own.. Don't go I can't do this on my own.. Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night.. I can't live with myself so stay with me tonight.. Don't go.. Don't go.. [Lights]. If I let you in you'd just want out.. If I tell you the truth you'd vie for a lie..

And it says this love will surely last forever. This love will surely last always.

Your nails grow long your eyes turn red. You say ""Forever dear and a day"". You swear that you're never going to go away. And my feet won't move to run the other way. And I can't wake up to save my life. Oh I can't wake up to save my life. In my nightmare you forgive me. The cruellest gift you could ever give me. You say that you understand me now. But your eyes say ""Brother I'll get you somehow"". And then the lightning streaks across the room. You smell like something fresh from the tomb. You squeeze too hard you insist on kissing. When it seems like half your face is missing. And you hair's turned into reptiles hissing. And I can't wake up to save my life. Oh I can't wake up to save my life. Things I done make my dreams go bad. Like Borstal boys coming home to dad. What you reap so shall you sow. Now feets don't fail me go man go. 'Cause I can't wake up to save my life. Oh I can't wake up to save my life. No I can't wake up. No I can't wake up. Oh I can't"

432,If we're talking about love. Then I have to tell you. Dear readers I'm not sure where I'm headed.. I've gotten lost before.. I've woke up stone drunk. Face down in the floor.. Late afternoon the house is hot.. I started I jumped up.. Everyone hates a bore.. Everybody hates a drunk.. This may be a lit invention. Professors muddled in their intent. To try to rope in followers. To float their malcontent.. As for this reader. I'm already spent.. Late afternoon the house is hot.. I started I jumped up.. Everyone hates a sad professor.. I hate where I wound up.. Dear readers my apologies.. I'm drifting in and out of sleep.. Long silence presents the tragedies. Of love. note the age. get afraid.. The surface hazy with attendant thoughts.. A lazy eye metaphor on the rocks.. Late afternoon the house is hot.. I started I jumped up.. Everyone hates a bore.. Everybody hates a drunk.. Everyone hates a sad professor.. I hate where I wound up.. I hate where I wound up.
434,Midnight one more night without sleeping. Watching 'til the morning comes creeping. Green door what's that secret you're keeping. There's an old piano and they play it hot. Behind the green door. Don't know what they're doing but they laugh alot. Behind the green door. I wish they'd let me in so I could find out what's. Behind the green door. Knocked once tried to tell them i'd been there. Door slam hospitality's thin there. Wonder just what's going on in there. I saw an eye ball peeping through a smoky cloud. Behind the green door. Well I said Joe sent me someone laughed out loud. Behind the green door. All I wanna do is join the happy crowd. Behind the green door. Midnight one more night without sleeping. Watching 'til the morning comes creeping. Green door what's that secret you're keeping. Green door what's that secret you're keeping. Green Door.

She's growing up. She has a young man waiting. She's growing up. She has a young man waiting. Wide eyes. She'll be street-wise. To the lies. And the jive talk. She'll find true love. And tenderness on the block. Daddy don't you ask her when she's coming in. And when she's home don't ask her where she's been. She's going out. She has a young man waiting. She's going out. Can't keep her young man waiting. She'll be okay. Let her have her day. It's a long way. It's a long walk. She'll find true love. And tenderness on the block. I know how much it hurts to see her go. She has a mind of her own you know. She's all grown up. She has a young man waiting. She's all grown up. She has a young man waiting. She was wide-eyed. Now she's street-wise. To the lies. And the jive talk. She'll find true love. And tenderness on the block. She'll find true love. And tenderness on the block.
441,We're at once like peas in a pod. Like gloves around a hand. Our arms are wrapped around each others shoulders. And then we're on fire with parity. With standards of golden. With birds that are of feathers of predictability. And while I am flying high. You fly beside. Just when I start to drop my guard then. Here you come with the Jekyll and Hyde. I get used to your light then the jarring blindside. Step off with the Jekyll and Hyde. When I drop my guard you bring out the dark side. I am done with your Jekyll and Hyde. [Souleye]. I thought there was a protocol. On how you treat a friend. Your hot and cold I'd share my soul. But you're not listening. So I'm not stressing it. No pressure on my mind at all. Just curious about your split personality. Allegory double life. One moment's really nice. Next moment exploding on me like it was dynamite. With no responsibility to be accountable. I guess I'm gone free away now from your hold. When you're kind your kind is transcendent. Harmony rules the land. But sure as night turns to day it is always uncertain. Just when I'm lulled by your sweet side. The harder the fall when you flip the script each time. Here you come with the Jekyll and Hyde. I get used to your light then the jarring blindside. Step off with the Jekyll and Hyde. When I drop my guard you bring out the dark side. Here you come with the Jekyll and Hyde. I get used to your light then the jarring blindside. Step off with the Jekyll and Hyde. When I drop my guard you bring out the dark side. I am done with your Jekyll and Hyde. I am done with your Jekyll and Hyde

You could dream of. I'd do anything anything. For your love. For your love. Listen now baby. I gotta tell you true. Just how much that. I love you. I got a sweet feeling. I know is real. This kind of love. You can't conceal. I'd do anything anything. You could dream of. I'd do anything anything. For your love. For your love

452,No one's listening. They painted up your secrets. With the lies they told to you. And the least they ever gave you. Was the most you ever knew. And I wonder where these dreams go. When the world gets in your way. What's the point in all this screaming. No one's listening anyway. Your voice is small and fading. And you hide in here unknown. And your mother loves your father. 'Cause she's got nowhere to go. And she wonders where these dreams go. 'Cause the world got in her way. What's the point in ever trying. Nothing's changing anyway. They press their lips against you. And you love the lies they say. And I tried so hard to reach you. But you're falling anyway. And you know I see right through you. Cause the world gets in your way. What's the point in all this screamin'. You're not listening anyway

(These lyrics are only heard at the end of the full length vocal mix). It's not the arrogant... superiority. It's not the pressure. It's the feeling of minority.

Take all from life that you can get!. You better believe it!. My love is powerful. Whoah oh.... Love's power. Maybe.... May the sun go rise. Take away the snake this power the sun burns (?). Make me feel the show (?).

What am I supposed to do. When the best part of me was always you. What am I suppose to say. When I'm all choked up and you're Ok. I'm falling to pieces yeah. I'm falling to pieces.

460,As I walk into club at night. I can feel the burn of hungry eyes. They love to look me up and down like. And everyone's exposing talent like. like some freaking beauty pagent. So I flung the crown onto the ground. And I ripped up the sash. And I traded the ball gown for a Lbd. And a bunch of cash. But you bet that I kept my heels on. When I went up to dance. And the whispers around with a frown. Sayin' girl that ain't pretty. Hey then I'd rather be ugly. Baby I say ok just as long as I love me. Baby I say ok. (I don't give a sshh! Don't give a damn). I say ok (come and lay it on me if you can). Baby I say ok. (I don't give a sshh! Don't really care). I say ok (come and lay it on me if you dare). Sure your gotta love an atitude. But this scene is steaming up with rude. Poser posing like a fashion shoot. And everyone is dishin' fouls. Like they're fucking Simon Cowell. So I flung the crown onto the ground. And I ripped up the sash. And I traded the ball gown for a Lbd. And a bunch of cash. But you bet that I kept my heels on. When I went up to dance. And the whispers around with a frown. Sayin' girl that ain't pretty. Hey then I'd rather be ugly. Baby I say ok just as long as I love me. Baby I say ok. (I don't give a sshh! Don't give a damn). I say ok (come and lay it on me if you can). Baby I say ok. (I don't give a sshh! Don't really care). I say ok (come and lay it on me if you dare). Cause I can feel the kick drum in. My body like a heart beat. And it's somewhere deep inside. That dirty bass I lose me. In corner of my eye I saw someone. Falling off their seat. And the whispers around with a frown. Sayin' girl that ain't pretty. Hey then I'd rather be ugly. Baby I say ok just as long as I love me. Baby I say ok. (I don't give a sshh! Don't give a damn). I say ok (come and lay it on me if you can). Baby I say ok. (I don't give a sshh! Don't really care). I say ok (come and lay it on me if you dare) (x2)

468,I think I'm coming undone. I think I'm getting started. Us humans we don't know one thing. About ourself or anything. And I for one know nothing. But you can tell me something. You can whisper something. You think I'm coming undone. You think I'm going crazy. Us humans we don't know one thing. About ourself or anything. And he for one knows everything.

469,Living free is gaining on me. Can't keep ahead of my dreams. My relief turned out a thief. Smooth as rocks in the stream. This old time is a sad affair. You be glad you're not there. It ties your hands. It spikes your drink. I'd say more but I can't think. Lazy Jim took a bottle with him. Tried to flag down a train. Left a note. Couldn't read what he wrote. A light came on in my brain. This old time is a sad affair. You be glad you're not there. It ties your hands. It spikes your drink. I'd say more but I can't think. The hills are gold. Mornings are cold. Don't know a soul on the street. I keep to myself like everyone else. Nobody says much to me. Go to bed fight thoughts in my head. In the two in between wake and sleep. Rats to kill contracts to fill. It's on ice but it won't keep. . This old time is a sad affair. You be glad you're not there. It ties your hands. It spikes your drink. I'd say more but I can't think.

You take the good along with the bad. Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad. You know you love him you can't understand. Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man. . He's got me smiling when I should be ashamed. Got me laughing when my heart is in pain. Oh no I must be a fool. Cause I do anything you ask me to. You're just a fool you know you're in love. You've got to face it to live in this world. You take the good along with the bad. Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad. You know you love him you can't understand. Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man. . Without my man I don't wanna live. You think I'm lying but I'm telling you like it is. He's got my nose open and that's no lie. And I I'm gonna keep him satisfied. You're just a fool you know you're in love. You've got to face it to live in this world. You take the good along with the bad. Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad. You know you love him you can't understand. Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man. . A wave of action speaks louder than words. The truest thing that I ever heard. I trust my man and all that he do. And I and I do anything you ask me to. You're just a fool you know you're in love. You've got to face it to live in this world.

471,Haven't seen you since high school. Good to see you're still beautiful. Gravity hasn't started to pull. Quite yet I bet you're rich as hell. One that's five and one that's three. Been two years since he left me. Good to know that you got free. That town I know is keeping you down on your knees. These bruises make for better conversation. Loses the vibe that separates. Is gonna let you in again. You're not alone in how you've been. Everybody loses we all got bruises. We all got bruises. Have you seen him? (not in years). How 'bout her? (no but I hear. She's in Queens with the man of her dreams). Funny back then she said that about you. Que sera? You'll never guess who I saw. Remember Johnny B.. Remember him we were best friends practically.

472,If this was easy where would I be?. I haven't said I have all the answers how could anyone?. Can't stop looking at the lights all around my head. I'm missing the darker side of the man. He's on his knees looking for the door. But everybody's giving him applause. Crashed the car into a wall. But everybody's calling for more. It's called the end of rock and roll. These days are numbered counted out in loss. Faith and spirit walking hand in hand. To meet a wall made of sound. But where does that sound find a place today. Maybe we came to the wrong show I've seen this before. It’s called the end of rock and roll. Oh shadow take me leave nothing still. 'cause I've not seen the miracle how could anyone?. We ask too much of the song to come and save our souls. When all it's trying to do now is save its own. Maybe we came to the wrong show I've seen this before. Maybe we came to the wrong show I've seen this before. It’s called the end of rock and roll. It’s called the end of rock and roll
473,The way you move is like a fool on rainstorm. And I'm a house of cards. You're the kinda reckless that should send me running. But I kinda know that I won't get far. And you stood there in front of me just. Close enough to touch. Close enough to hope you couldn't see. What I was thinking of. Drop everything now. Meet me in the pouring rain. Kiss me on the sidewalk. Take away the pain. 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile. Get me with those green eyes baby. As the lights go down. Give me something that'll hunt me when you're not around. 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile. My mind forgets to remind me. You're a bad idea. You touch me once and it's really something. You find I'm even better than you. Imagined I would be. I'm on my guard for the rest of the world. But with you I know it's no good. And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would. Drop everything now. Meet me in the pouring rain. Kiss me on the sidewalk. Take away the pain. 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile. Get me with those green eyes baby. As the lights go down. Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around. 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile. I run my fingers through your hair. And watch the lights go out. Just keep on keeping your eyes on me. It's just wrong enough to make you feel right. Lead me up the staircase. Won't you whisper soft and slow. I'm captivated by you baby. Like a firework show. Drop everything now. Meet me in the pouring rain. Kiss me on the sidewalk. Take away the pain. 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile. Get me with those green eyes baby. As the lights go down. Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around. 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile. Sparks fly baby smile sparks fly
475,He´s drinking cold corona. Feels like is getting older. Now and noticing how he's finding. Grey hairs left in the shower. Tattoos fade by the hour. And he can't understand these feelings. Why life is getting him down. He used to smile now he frowns. And cries inside. It's been this way for a while. And he can´t seem to put things right. When life has been unkind. And you're losing your mind. Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find. It feels like time's not on your side. He doesn't like to mention. Applying for his pension. So his children don't know he's heading. Into a mid-life crisis. He can't afford the prices for. The new kitchen floor he's buying. He's been a drunk all his life. Two kids and dog and a wife. He doesn´t know. And in the daytime he just sits and watches television shows. When life has been unkind. And you´re losing your mind. Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find. It feels like time´s not on your side. Don't know why but somehow. The ones you love you hate now. you feel down and blue. Look at what you've thrown away. They stood beside you all the way. Now it's too late it's too late for you. When life has been unkind. And you´re losing your mind. Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find. It feels like time´s not on your side

I started to learn. How I could be somebody else. Discovered the girl I thought. I could never be. And now I am hurt. You're leaving but I won't forget. You rocked my world (you rocked my world). Made me forget myself. I started to learn (started to learn). How I could be somebody else. Discovered the girl (discovered the girl). I thought I could never be. Now I am hurt you're leaving.

482,(featuring Damien Rice). The power of orange knickers. The power of orange knickers. The power of orange knickers. Under my petty coat. The power of listening to what. You don't want me to know. Can somebody tell me now who is this terrorist. Those girls that smile kindly then rip your life to pieces?. Can somebody tell me nwo am I alone with this. This little pill in my hand and with this secret kiss. Am I alone in this.... A matter of complication. When you become a twist. For their latest drink. As they're transitioning. Can somebody tell me now who is this terrorist. This little pill in my hand that keeps the pain laughin'. Can somebody tell me now a way out of this -. That sacred pipe of red stone could blow me out of this kiss. Am I alone in this.... Shame shame time to leave me now. Shame shame you've had your fun. Shame shame for letting me think that I would be the one. Can somebody tell me now who is this terrorist. This little pill in my hand or this secret kiss. Am I alone in this kiss. Am I alone in this kiss

484,Have you been to the broken bricks girl. Snuck down through the cyclone fence. Past the caution tape. And the security gate. Back way to the breakroom bench. Well there's a little corner where you first got kissed. And felt your boyfriends fist and made the company list. And there's a little spot where your dad ate lunch. And your brother landed his first punch yeahyeahyeah. Well have you been to the broken bricks girl. Seen the barrels that they left behind. Seen the machine that cut aluminium clean. And got tape from the caution sign. And broke into the window panes. Just a rusty colored rain that drives a man insane. You try to jump over water but you land in oil. Climb the ladder up a broken crane yeahyeahyeah. Don't go to the broken bricks girl. It's not a place that you want to be. Think of the spot your father spent his life. Demolition calls it Building C. Demolition calls it Building C now. Demolition calls it Building C now.

486,I tied myself with wire. To let the horses roam free. Playing with the fire. until the fire played with me. The stone was semi-precious. We were barely conscious. Two souls too smart to be. in the realm of certainty. Even on our wedding day. We set ourselves on fire. Oh God do not deny her. It's not if I believe in love. But if love believes in me. Oh believe in me. At the moment of surrender. I folded to my knees. I did not notice the passers-by. And they did not notice me. I've been in every black hole. At the altar of the dark star. My body's now a begging bowl. That's begging to get back. begging to get back. To my heart. To the rhythm of my soul. To the rhythm of my unconsciousness. To the rhythm that yearns. To be released from control. I was punching in the numbers. at the ATM machine. I could see in the reflection. A face staring back at me. At the moment of surrender. Of vision over visibility. I did not notice the passers-by. And they did not notice me. I was speeding on the subway. Through the stations of the cross. Every eye looking every other way. Counting down 'til the pain would stop. At the moment of surrender. Of vision over visibility. I did not notice the passers-by. And they did not notice me

518,(Anderson/Squire). I see the cold mist in the night. And watch the hills roll out of sight.. I watch in ev'ry single way. Inside out outside in ev'ry day.. The sun can warm the coldest dawn. And move the movement on the lawn.. I learn in ev'ry single day. Inside out outside in ev'ry way.. And there you are. Making it up but you're sure that it is a star. And boy you'll see. It's an illusion shining down in front of me. And then you'll say. Even in time we shall control the day. When what you'll see. Deep inside the day's controlling you and me.. And one peculiar point I see. As one of many ones of me.. As truth is gathered I rearrange. Inside out outside in inside out outside in. Perpetual change.. And there you are. Saying we have the moon so now the stars. When all you see. Is near disaster gazing down on you and me. And there you're standing. Saying we have the whole world in our hands. When all you'll see. Deep inside the world's controlling you and me.. You'll see perpetual change.. You'll see perpetual change.. And there you are. Making it up but you're sure that it is a star. And boy you'll see. It's an illusion shining down in front of me. And then you'll say. Even in time we shall control the day. When what you'll see. Deep inside the day's controlling you and me.. As mist and sun are both the same. We look on as pawns of their game.. They move to testify the day. Inside out outside in inside out outside in. All of the way.. Ah Ah..

520,"If I should find myself in blackest night. And fear is stabbin' me all over. A tiny prayer cracks the dark with light. And I here sounds behind my wall.. Inside a still small voice it calls and calls.. Then like a thunder bolt it falls and falls:. My God!. When life becomes more real than children's games. Or we've become too old to play them. We'll grow old gracefully. We'll hide our shame. but there's that voice behind the wall.. And like my conscience it is still and small.. Each word is mercy protects us all:. My God!. ""Et in lux perpetuo"". ""Deu domine"". ""Et in pax aeternus"". ""Deu domine"". I was a boy when tempted fell sometimes. And fell so low no one could see me. Save for the eyes of Him that sees my crime.. When sheep like me have drifted lost. All frightened children who are tempest tossed. Down flies His wrath like an albatross:. My God!."
521,by Gail Collins and Felix Pappalardi. Outside my window is a tree.. Outside my window is a tree.. There only for me.. And it stands in the gray of the city. No time for pity for the tree or me.. There is a world of pain. In the falling rain. Around me.. Is there a reason for today?. Is there a reason for today?. Do you remember?. I can hear all the cries of the city. No time for pity for a growing tree.. Chorus. First Verse. Chorus.
522,"Said ""Angel Do you want a ride?"". Said ""Angel I'm tired and I'm lonely. And I need somebody by my side"". It's a long road that stretched from Vegas to nowhere. But it'd been an even longer time. Since he found some piece of mind. And he lived off of bubblegum and cigarettes. And got his nourishment from all-night stores. Thought he'd just keep driving. Til he outdrove his sorrow. He said ""Angel Oh do you want a ride?"". Said ""Angel I'm tired and I'm lonely. And I need somebody by my side"". Her feet were warm and tired. But as determined as a soul. She left with no regrets. But also no posessions did she own. Her heart was as fragile as her thin loving arms. She's praying to god to take away her lonely. When he pulled on aside of the road. And he said ""Angel Oh do you want a ride?"". Said ""Angel I'm tired and I'm lonely. And I need somebody by my side"". The highway goes on forever. I've seen a thousand men like him before. And I've seen a thousand angels that. Got into the car. They're just a couple of lost souls. Looking to rekindle some sort of forgotten dream. I hope they find what they're looking for. In the solace of the road. They said ""Angel Do you want a ride?"". Said ""Angel I'm tired and I'm lonely. I'm tired and I'm lonely. I'm tired and I'm lonely. I'm tired and I'm lonely. And I need to have somebody. By my angel""."

I get so fearful about the future. I hear the shame of my accuser. But that ain't you. I found strength but it wasn't what I thought. I found peace in the places I forgot. I found riches ain't the things that I had bought. I found out. The day I lost myself was the day that I found God. I get caught chasing my own illusions. I get so lost in these confusions. I keep on looking for my own solutions. But that ain't you that ain't you no. My enemies weren't the ones I had fought. My liberties weren't the freedoms I had sought. What I learned weren't the lessons I'd been taught. I found out the day I lost myself was. The day that I found God. Where is God out in the darkness?. Cause the voices in my head ain't talking honest. They're saying maybe you made us then forgot us. But that ain't you that ain't you no. And all I know is that I still don't know a lot. I don't know how it ends I'm in the middle of this plot. Yeah and I found grace for the man that I am not. Yeah I found out the day I lost myself. Yeah I found out. The day I lost myself. Was the day that I found God

533,(Spoken Word). So here we are at the end. And at the same time we're at the beginning. Of this misadventure.. Why I had to go down a dead end street. At 200 miles an hour. Screaming for vengeance and embracing death. That's still something I'm trying to figure out.. You know a part of me thinks this is some big master plan. To expose the raw nerve endings of dysfunction so I can heal.. But you know addicts we think everything's about us don't we?. Man it got so convoluted polluted and distorted. I turned it into my armor my defense mechanism. And my weapon of self destruction.. Yeah I had a fucked up childhood. And I was a troubled teen.. Those are facts.. How I got there? That's a story told by many voice.. It's not my job to blame anybody anymore. I just need to accept the path I was given.. This is without a doubt. My life... after death.

545,I'm so tired of being here. Suppressed by all my childish fears. And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave. 'Cause your presence still lingers here. And it won't leave me alone. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. You used to captivate me by your resonating light. Now I'm bound by the life you've left behind. Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams. Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone. But though you're still with me. I've been alone all along. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me
548,There you are. In a darkened room. And you're all alone. Looking out the window. Your heart is cold and lost the will to love. Like a broken arrow. Here I stand in the shadows. Come to me come to me. Can't you see that. Nobody wants to be lonely. Nobody wants to cry. My body's longing to hold you. So bad it hurts inside. Time is precious and it's slipping away. And i've been waiting for you all of my life. Nobody wants to be lonely so why. Why don't you let me love you. Can you hear my voice. Do you hear my song. It's a serenade. So your heart can find me. And suddenly your flying down the stairs. Into my arms baby. Before I start going crazy. Run to me run to me. Cause I'm dying. Nobody wants to be lonely. Nobody wants to cry. My body's longing to hold you. So bad it hurts inside. Time is precious and it's slipping away. And i've been waiting for you all of my life. Nobody wants to be lonely so why. Why don't you let me love you. I want to feel you deeply. Just like the air you're breathing. I need you here in my life. Don't walk away don't walk away. Don't walk away don't walk away. No no no no. Nobody wants to be lonely. Nobody wants to cry. Nobody wants to be lonely. I don't want to be lonely. Nobody wants to cry. I don't want to cry. My body's longing to hold you. I'm longing to hold you. So bad it hurts inside. Time is precious and it's slipping away. And i've been waiting for you all of my life. Nobody wants to be lonely so why. Why don't you let me love you. Why don't you let me love you. Why oh why why why why why. Nobody wants to be lonely. I don't want to cry. Nobody wants to cry. My body's longing to hold you. So bad it hurts inside. Nobody wants to be lonely. I don't want to be lonely. Nobody wants to cry. My body's longing to hold you. So bad it hurts inside. Time is precious and it's slipping away. And i've been waiting for you all of my life. Nobody wants to be lonely so why. Why don't you let me love you. . by Karol Godinho
549,I'm lying here on the floor where you left me. I think I took too much. I'm crying here what have you done?. I thought it would be fun. I can't stay on your life support. There's a shortage in the switch. I can't stay on your morphine. Cause it's making me itch. I said I tried to call the nurse again. But she's being a little bitch. I think I'll get out of here.

560,Words like violence. Break the silence. Come crashing in. Into my little world. Painful to me. Pierce right through me. Cant you understand. Oh my little girl. All I ever wanted. All I ever needed. Is here in my arms. Words are very unnecessary. They can only do harm. Vows are spoken. To be broken. Feelings are intense. Words are trivial. Pleasure remains. So does the pain. Words are meaningless. And forgettable. All I ever wanted. All I ever needed. Is here in my arms. Words are very unnecessary. They can only do harm. Enjoy the silence
563,There's a pale horse coming. And I'm going to ride it. I'll rise in the morning. My fate decided. I'm a dead man walking. I'm a dead man walking. In St James' Parish I was born and christened. I've got my story Mister. Ain't no need for you to listen. It's just a dead man talking. Once I had a job I had a a girl. Between our dreams and actions lies this world. In the deep forest their blood and tears rushed over me. All I could feel was the drugs and the shotgun. And my fear up inside of me. Like a dead man talkin'. 'Neath the summer sky my eyes went black. Sister I won't ask for forgiveness. My sins are all I have. Now the clouds above my prisonMove slowly across the sky. There's a new day. coming and my dreams are full to-night.

565,I've met some ladies and then some girls. But they don't tell you they just want a whirl. It's kind of funny a little sad. 'Cause they're not happy they're just kind of glad. To be with me for just a night. And maybe even turn out the lights we'll turn out the lights. I need time to ease my mind make up my mind which one to find. Two sides of the coin to choose from two sides of the coin they are mine. Two sides of the coin I'm gettin' weary. Which one should I choose I need time. I'd like to say a word or two about the women we all seem to know. They're all around us they're everywhere. You meet them this place and then meet them there. Then you deside to pick a mate. Because you're tired of all those dates of all those dates. I need time to ease my mind make up my mind which one to find. Two sides of the coin to choose from two sides of the coin they are mine. Two sides of the coin I'm gettin' weary. Which one should I choose I need time. Choose one!. Two sides of the coin to choose from two sides of the coin they are mine.

Will I ever learn my lesson?. Chorus. I don't believe what they tell me anymore. About girls who can read your mind. Who know what you're thinking all the time. Who can read your mind. If she knew what I was thinking. She whould never ever leave me behind. I drank a bottle of wine. I tried to buy me some time. But something's wrong with me. And nobody wants to listen. I think of her every day. I know she's probably hangin'. Out with Donnie Vie. And they're doing more than kissin'. Repeat chorus. Don't believe it don't believe it.

572,I knew a girl in shades of blue. Who broke my heart and said “We’re through”. Waiting for a girl like you. To change me like the weather. Since she left me high and dry. Split me like a Gemini. All those days are passing by. Like flowers in December. Friday is forever we belong together. So come on come on. And don’t you say never. If you go then I know there is no tomorrow. So come on come on. You should know better. It’s right it’s time for you and I. Friday is forever we should be together tonight. No more living in her head. No more crashing in my bed.

576,I went out walking the other day. Seen a little girl crying along the way. She'd been hurt so bad said she'd never love again. Someday your crying girl will end. And you'll find once again. Two hearts are better than one. Two hearts girl get the job done. Two hearts are better than one. Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes. But I was living in a world of childish dreams. Someday these childish dreams must end. To become a man and grow up to dream again. Now I believe in the end. Two hearts are better than one.... Sometimes it might seem like it was planned. For you to roam empty hearted through this land. Though the world turns you hard and cold. There's one thing mister that I know. That's if you think your heart is stone. And that you're rough enough to whip this world alone. Alone buddy there ain't no peace of mind. That's why I'll keep searching till I find my special one. Two hearts are better than one....

Casino doors swing open the rich men raise their eyes. They say who is this beauty as elegant as ice. And later there's an accident another charge d'affair. Is lying in a pool of blood no witness anywhere. And they say she was a hundred miles away. The hotel porter saw her climb the stairs. And the maid with trembling hands knows what to say. When the judge says ""Are your sure"" ""I'm sure"" she swears. Pavanne cold steel woman Pavanne. How do you love a woman. With eyes cold as the barrel of her gun. Who's never missed her mark on anyone. Pavanne Pavanne Pavanne. At the presidential palace a thousand people saw. His excellency leave his car and never make the door. The blood flows from his fingers as he clutches at the stain. He staggers like a drunken man lies twisted in the rain. And they say she grew up well provided for. Her mother used to keep her boys for sure. And father's close attentions led to talk. She learned to stab her food with a silver fork. Pavanne cold steel woman Pavanne. And they say she didn't do it for the money. And they say she didn't do it for a man. They say that she did it for the pleasure. The pleasure of the moment. Pavanne cold steel woman Pavanne. How do you stop this woman. When everyone is moving in a trance. Like prisoners of some slow courtly dance. Pavanne Pavanne Pavanne. Pavanne Pavanne Pavanne"

The day I lost my innocence. Chasing you into the sun. It's okay when I'm afraid. It's okay when I'm a fool. Who only plays the cards he's got. It's all we have. So good so far. It's not over 'til we're done. And we've only just begun. I'm in the middle of the longest fight. I've ever had in all my life. And it ain't over 'til we've won. So here's to tomorrow.

651,Midnight falls on the snow-lit trees. And as I stand inside I know that I. Can't watch life through a window. My indecision is blocking the door. It's like a religion. That I never ask for more. I might stumble and fall. What's someone like me. Doing in a life like this?. I can't see. What someone like me. Is doing in a life like this. Slipping back into the past. Sun comes up and streams. Through the blinds. And as I throw my clothes on. Do my hair wrong. Stare into my mirror. Telling myself that everyone falls. Take the first step. That's the trick of it all. Bounce back like a ball. What's someone like me. Doing in a life like this ?.... My mind is filled with. Runaway dreams. I can't wake up. I don't know what it means. You see I fell asleep. With the television on. When I woke up it was gone. I read my horoscope. To see what's in store. I get a little lazy but. I want more I want more. What's someone like me. Doing in a life like this ?. I can't see. What someone like me. Is doing in a life like this....
652,See me in the mirror if you want to. See me in the mirror if you really want to. Maybe not too clear but the face you'll see is mine. Do you feel my eyes burning through you. Do you feel the burn when my eyes see through you. Do you see my eyes when they burn into your mind. I can feel the teardrops hit the ground where I'm layed. I can feel you breathing while I sleep through the day. See you in a vision in the dark with no light?. Your soul may go to heaven but your heart's mine tonight. Do you feel my skin when you touch me. Do you feel my skin when you reach and touch me. Cold and blue and thin but it's still somehow alive. And you can feel my blood running through you. You can feel the rush of my blood run through you. You can feel the gush when my blood runs up your spine. And I can feel the teardrops hit the ground where I'm layed. I can feel you breathing while I sleep through the day. See you in a vision in the dark with no light?. Your soul may go to heaven but your heart's mine tonight. See me in your mirror if you want to. See me in the mirror if you really want to. Maybe not too clear but the face you'll see is mine. See me in the mirror mirror mirror. See me in the mirror mirror. See me in the mirror mirror. See me in the mirror mirror. See me in the mirror mirror mirror.

658,(MacDonald / Salter). Here I stand looking looking around me. While all around me what do I see. Unhappy faces behind a painted smile. Heartache and loneliness dressed up in modern style. Unhappy people living in sin and shame. Reflections of myself life is no easy game. We're caught in the trade winds. The trade winds of our time. Here I stand looking looking around me. While all around me what do I see. Young girls who'll soon become. Streetwalkers in the night. Young boys the restless breed. looking for a fight. Children both rich and poor. They're searching for the truth. If they don't find it. God help tomorrow's youth. We're caught in the trade winds. The trade winds of our time. Trade winds are blowing blowing around me. While all around me what do I see. Hatred and jealousy. Brotherhood is dying. Love is the answer. But nobody's buying. Good people turning bad. Some don't but they are few. The winds are blowing. The choice is all up to you. We're caught in the trade winds. The trade winds of our time. Yes we're caught up in the trade winds. The trade winds of our time. We are riding on the trade winds. The trade winds of our time.

Some day I'll find my love. And how thrilling that moment will be. When the prince of my dreams comes to me.. He'll whisper ""I love you"". And steal a kiss or two. Though he's maybe far away.

668,I am as ugly as I seem. Worse than all your dreams. Could ever make me out to be. And it makes me want to scream. When it's halloween. And the kids are laughing. The rogue is a bank he's never broke. But worth as much as a joke that no one is laughing at. Can you believe some things are not. Appealing and there's a spot. On the ceiling of my childhood bedroom. And can these dreams you can't imagine. Will never match the vision. That you had decided for me. You are to take away from me. Things that are mine and it's not your right. Out that you'd wouldn't expect to find out. Can it be that I don't want what you want?. And the only thing I could care for. Is a place in a home that is safe and warm. Safe and warm safe and warm safe and warm. Judge yourself if you feel the need. Just let me known to be. In search of the truth myself. There is a drop of blood on the ground. And it seems to me that it's not my kind. And I can't be sure if it's yours or mine. I am as ugly as I seem. Worse than all your dreams. Could ever make me. Could ever make me. Could ever make me. Could ever make me

And have headed for the sea sea. Those creatures jumped the barricades. And have headed for the sea. She began to breathe. To breathe at the thought of such freedom. Stood and whispered to her child: belong. She held the child and whispered. With calm calm: belong. Stood and whispered to her child; belong. She held the child and whispered. With calm calm: belong. These barricades can only hold for so long. Her world collapsed early Sunday morning. She took the child held tight. Opened the window. A breath this song how long. And knew knew: belong.

My mother father lover friend and enemy. Where are my companions?. They're prisoners of death now and taken far from me. And where are the dreams I dreamed in the days of my youth. They took me to illusion when they promised me the truth. And what do sleepers need to make them listen. Why do they need more proof?. This is a strange this is a strange affair. Won't you give me an answer?. Why is your heart so hard towards the one who loves you best?. When the man with the answer. Has wakened you and warned you and called you to the test.

676,"In the earliest days of my shoplifting career. You could safely say I was filled with fear.. It was nail biting work from the very start. But several quick sucesses soon gave me heart.. After a while I could pick or nick or steal. Some shirts some trousers and a few LPs.. No-one ever stopped me they didn't seem to care.. It sometimes seemed to me that there was no-one there.. Then a fine summers day my mates and me. Set off down the westend on our usual spree.. Things were as normal for an hour or so. Then my nimble hands were a bit too slow.. Two store detectives made a fast approach. One grabbed my jacket (you're nicked!). The other grabbed my throat.. So they caught me at last one said with joy:. ""You'll have to do some time my light fingered boy!"". If only I'd remembered my common sense. They captured me red-handed with evidence.. If I go to the manager and say I'm sorry. Maybe he'll forgive me for my youthful folly.. But what will me social worker say. If I don't come home today?. He'll give me a clout!. What if they don't let me out?. I told him I'm on me own!. Don't they understand?. I'm from a broken home!. I'll tell them I'm the product of a broken home. And I always went out on my own.. Was it too late to say I'd pay. And I'll never steal again 'till the end of my days?. Because I have no friends to call as such. Money and posessions I did not have much. So I started to steal in order to get by.. The quickness of the hand deceives the eye.. deceives the eye the eye the eye...."

Trying to get the music right. Two go out working. Three stay home at night. That's when she said she was pretending. Like she knew the plan. That's when I knew she was pretending. Pretending to understand. Pretending pretending. Pretending pretending. Satisfied but lost in love. Situations change. You're never who you used to think you are. How strange. Chorus.

Don't be pretending about how you feel. Don't be pretending that your love is real. Pretending pretending. Pretending pretending.

683,We signed up in San Antone my brother Paul and me. To fight with Ben McCulloch and the Texas infantry. Well the poster said we'd get a uniform and seven bucks a week. The best rations in the army and a rifle we could keep. When I first laid eyes on the general I knew he was a fightin' man. He was every inch a soldier every word was his command. Well his eyes were cold as the lead and steel forged into tools of war. He took the lives of many and the souls of many more. Well they marched us to Missouri and we hardly stopped for rest. Then he made this speech and said we're comin' to the test. Well we've got to take Saint Louie boys before the yankees do. If we control the Mississippi then the Federals are through. Well they told us that our enemy would all be dressed in blue. They forgot about the winter's cold and the cursed fever too. My brother died at Wilson's creek and Lord I seen him fall. We fell back to the Boston Mountains in the North of Arkansas. CHORUS. Goddamn you Ben McCulloch. I hate you more than any other man alive. And when you die you'll be a foot soldier just like me. In the devil's infantry. And on the way to Fayetteville we cursed McCulloch`s name. And mourned the dead that we'd left behind and we was carrying the lame. I killed a boy the other night who'd never even shaved. I don't even know what I'm fightin' for I ain't never owned a slave. So I snuck out of camp and then I heard the news next night. The Yankees won the battle and McCulloch lost his life

Who made the blunder that's what we're hearing every day. I think they 're getting it wrong it makes you wonder. Why we all have to stay it's not as if we're changing history.

(Burnin’ for you) You got me lifted and lifted you lift me up. Woke up in a sweat those ghosts in my head. Had a grip but I slipped on by. It’s a whole new day as the darkness fades. And the sun’s climbing in the sky. I concede my love that I need your love. I’m before you a broken man. And it’s only you no substitutes who can renew this soul again. You got me higher than Kilimanjaro. Got me believin’ I can “save the day”. I’m up and running like their ain’t no tomorrow. I’d rather burn for you than fade away. I’d rather burn for you than go my way. I’m a whole new guy with a whole new vibe. Changed inside – more flame in the fire. Can’t stop won’t stop praying for desire.

But the power of persuasion is no match for anticipation. Chorus:. Like a finger running down a seam. From a whisper to a scream. So I whisper and I scream. But don't get me wrong. Please don't leave me waitin' too long. Waitin' too long. Waitin' too long. Waitin' too long. Hey. Oh oh oh oh oh. Oh if the customers like it then they'll keep on paying.

703,All I had now is gone. Was not always alone. Not yet shed my last tear. For the child of my fear. What's true for my eyes. Could be all made up in disguise. Once out there now is here. It's the child of my fear. These words I'm singing. These days I'm giving. These tears I'm paying. But my child of fear is staying. On and on. It tells lies over me. Or I'm not what I think to be. Gave up all that was dear. For the child of my fear. Like a silent thief. Stole my faith my belief. What was doubt now is clear. I'm the child of my fear. These words I was singing. These days I was giving. These tears I was paying. But my child of fear was staying. These roads I'd taken. Seemed all mistaken. Now the truth was spoken. And I feel the spell is broken. Gone. Forever gone

You can tell her that I'm easily found. Tell her there's a spot out 'neath Abram's Bridge. And tell here there's a. Darkness on the edge of town. Everybody's got a secret Sonny. Something that they just can't face. Some folks spend their whole lives trying to keep it. They carry it with them every step that they take. Till some day they just cut it loose. Cut it loose or let it drag 'em down. Where no one asks any questions. Or looks too long in your face. In the darkness on the edge of town. Some folks are born into a good life. Other folks get it anyway anyhow. I lost my money and I lost my wife. Then things don't seem to matter much to me now. Tonight I'll be on that hill 'cause I can't stop. I'll be on that hill with everything I got. Lives on the line where dreams are found and lost. I'll be there on time and I'll pay the cost. For wanting things that can only be found. In the darkness on the edge of town

713,You gave your line. You fell in love. You feel the shadow. There's no more to borrow. There's no more to steal. And no more to feel. I know I know I know. I know I know I know.

Wish less was going on. Wish I could just throw the ball. And ignore it all. (Constantly distracted by the noise of my ping pong). It's a dance with the devil. A stumbling tango. It's a dance with the devil. Trying to borrow from tomorrow. It's a dance. It's a dance. It's a dance. But what what is it worth waking up with a crown of clouds?. What is it worth when my head spins out with doubt?. Wish I could measure when the poison is pouring out. Oh. It's a dance. Oh no oh no I don't need you (it's a dance). Oh no oh no I don't need you (it's a dance). Oh no oh no I don't need you (it's a dance). Oh no oh no (it's a...)
715,Tears on your blackmail. Written to ransom. A point of the fingernail. Says that he's handsome. Clowntime is over. Time to take cover. While others just talk and talk. Somebody's watching where the others don't walk. Clowntime is over. A voice in the shadows. Says that his men know. He don't step back as expected. He's otherwise and unprotected. Chorus.

721,Music : Klaus Meine. Lyrics: Klaus Meine. The lights are slowly fading down. There's no one else just you and me. Nothing ever changed. I see your faces in the crowd. It seems I know each one of you. For all my life. I wish this night could last forever. But it's time to go. I saw you laugh I saw you cry. All for one and one for all. Nothing ever changed. The way you sang just blew my mind. It gave me chills from head to toe. What a glorious night. To me it could have lasted forever. But it's time to go. A moment in a million years. Is all I've got for you. A moment in a million years. To make some dreams come true. A moment that I won't forget. Until the day I die. A moment in a million years. Called life. The bus is waiting right outside. To hit the road and once again. I leave you all behind. I chase another dream tonight. And by the time you'll be home. I'll be far away. Nothing seems to last forever. It's time to go. A moment in a million years. Is all I've got for you. A moment in a million years. To make some dreams come true. A moment that I won't forget. Until the day I die. A moment in a million years.

763,Chorus:. If I should fall from grace with god. Where no doctor can relieve me. If Im buried neath the sod. But the angels wont receive me. Let me go boys. Let me go boys. Let me go down in the mud. Where the rivers all run dry. This land was always ours. Was the proud land of our fathers. It belongs to us and them. Not to any of the others. Let me go boys. Let me go boys. Let me go down in the mud. Where the rivers all run dry. Bury me at sea. Where no murdered ghost can haunt me. If I rock upon the waves. Then no corpse can lie upon me. Its coming up three boys. Keeps coming up three boys. Let them go down in the mud. Where the rivers all run dry. If I should fall from grace with god. Where no doctor can relieve me. If Im buried neath the sod. And still the angels wont receive me. Let me go boys. Let me go boys. Let me go down in the mud. Where the rivers all run dry
764,In Arezzo I dreamed a dream. Of Saint Francis who kneeled and prayed. For the birds and the beasts and all humankind. All through the night I felt drawn in by him. And I heard him call. Like a distant hymn. I retreated from the silence of my room. Stepping down the ancient stones washed with dawn. And entered the basilica that bore his name. Seeing his effigy I bowed my head. And my racing heart I gave to him. I kneeled and prayed. And the sleep that I could not find in the night. I found through him. I saw before me the world of his world. The bright fieldthe birds in abundance. All of nature of which he sang. Singing of him. All the beauty that surrounded him as he walked. His nature that was nature itself. And I heard him-I heard him speak. And the birds sang sweetly. And the wolves licked his feet. But I could not give myself to him. I felt another call from basilica itself. Tha call of art-the call of man. And the beauty of material drew me away. And I awokeand beheld upon the wall. The dream of Constantine. The handiwork of Piero della Francesca. Who had stood where I stood. With his brush stroked The Legend of the True Cross. He envisioned Constantine advancing to greet the enemy. But as he was passing the river. An unaccustomed fear gripped his bowels. An anticipation so overwhelming that it manifested in waves. All through the night a dream drew toward him. As an advancing Crusade. He slept in his tent on the battlefield. While his men stood guard. And an angel awoke him. Constantine within his dream awoke. And his men saw a light pass over the face of the king. The troubled King. And the angel came and showed to him. The sign of the true cross in heaven. And upon it was written. (In this sign shall thou conquer). In the distance the tents of his army were lit by moonlight. But another king of radiance lit the face of Constantine. And in the morning light. The artistseeing his work was done. Saw that it was good. (In this sign shall thou conquer). He let his brush drop and passed into a sleep of his own. And he dreamed of Constantine carrying into battle in his right hand. An immaculateundefiled single white Cross. Piero della Francescaas his bursh stroked the wall. Was filled with a torpor. And fell into a dream of his own. From the geometry of his heart he mapped it out. He saw the King risefitted with armor. Set upon a white horse. An immaculate cross in his right hand. He advanced toward the enemy. And the symmetrythe perfection of his mathematics. Caused the scattering of the enemy. Agitatedbrokenthey fled. And Piero della Francesca wakingcried out. All is art-all is future!. Oh lord let me die on the back of advanture. With a brush and an eye full of light. But as he advanced in age. The light was shorn from his eyes. And blindedhe laid upon his bed. On an October moring 1492and whispered. Oh lord let me die on the back of adventure. Oh lord let me die on the back of adventure. And a world away-a world away. On three great ships. Adventure itself as if to answer. Pulling into the New World. And as far as his eyes could see. No longer blind. All of nature unspoiled-beautiful-beautiful. In such a manner that would have lifted the heart of St.Francis. Into the realm of universal love
766,Don't play that song for me. Because it brings back the memories. Of the days that I once knew. Of the days that I spent with you. Oh no don't let it play. It fills my heart with pain. Please stop it right away. Because I remember just what it said. It said darling. You know that you lied. Boy you know that you lied. You know that you lied. You lied you lied you lied. Remember on our first date. You kissed me. Then you walked away. And I was only seventeen. I never dreamed that he could be so mean. Oh darling don't you play no more. Don't you dare play that song. You know you lied. Ohh
769,You wave at the sky with wide lovely eyes. Waves and waves of love go by. And through the garden with your secret key. Down the tunnel that leads to the sea. Step on the beach beneath the iron skies. You wave and wave your wide lovely eyes. Crystal waves and waves of love. You wave and say goodbye. Your dress sides with your wide lovely strides. And all along the street lately the stories are bound. They've dismantled the fun fair. And they've shut down the rides. They've hung the mermaids from the streetlights by their hair. And with wide lovely eyes you wave at the sky. And near the high window watching the ride. The waves of blue and the waves of love. You wave and say goodbye. The night expands I am expanding. I watch your hands like butterflies landing. All among the myths and the legends we create. And all the laughing stories we tell our friends. Close the windows clear up the mess. It's getting late it's darker and closer to the end. Through the tunnel and down the sea. And on the pebble beach releases you entire. And arrange your shoes side by side. You wave and wave with wide lovely eyes. Distant waves and waves of distant love. You wave and say goodbye
770,As long as I can think I've been. Running to be free. There's not a place that could have been too far. Had nothing but a bag of dreams. And this old guitar. A couple of songs to play for you an me. There's so much love inside of me. That wants to be released. I can't help it so I give it all away. What you give you get it back. So take my love just because it's all I have. Take my heart take my soul. I just never want it back. As long as I've been living. I've had music in my veins. I can't go on without it anymore. My suitcase is a wanderer. That takes me I believe. For a walk right across your heart. There's so much love inside of you. That wants to be released. And all you gotta do is let it go. What you give you get back. So take my love just because it's all I have. Take my heart take my soul. I just never want it back. Cause the love you give is the love you'll get. There's so much love inside of me. That wants to be released. I can't help it so I gave it all away. What you give you get back. So take my love just because it's all I have. What you give you get back. So take my love just because it's all I have. Take my heart take my soul. I just never want it back. Cause your love your love is all I have. All I have. Love is all we have
771,To every day there's a history. To every love that's lost there is tragedy. I saved a vision of you in my head. Watched a new universe being born raised and bred. In the calm of my bed. Some might say it's over now. I don't believe them. If I only got to you. I'd prove I'm right. Only when I dream. I hear you I'm near you. I hold you close to me. Only when I dream. I touch you and I breathe you. I feel you deep inside me. Things were never easy for me. In the temple we built to stay sacred and free. I came lookin' for more self esteem. All I found was your voice. On the answering machine. Simple and clean. Some might say it's too far gone. I don't believe them. If I could only talk to you. I'd prove I'm right. Only when I dream.... I tried to catch a butterfly. I tried to make God's summer sky. Heal me. Rain exploding in my face. Seems to fade without a trace. Heal me
772,I don't need no doctor. 'Cause I know what's ailing me. I don't need no doctor. 'Cause I know what's ailing me. All I need is my baby. You don't know I'm in misery. I don't need no doctor. I don't need no doctor. I don't need no doctor. My prescription tells me that. I don't need no doctor. My prescription tells me that. All I need is my baby. You don't know I'm in misery. I don't need no doctor. I don't need no doctor. I don't need no doctor. I don't need no doctor. Well the doctor said I need rest- ooh ooh. He put me on the critical list- ooh ooh. Keeping me safe from harm- ooh ooh. All I need is her sweet charm- ooh ooh. He gave me a medicated lotion that wouldn't do. Ooh yeah my emotion oh yeah no doctor no!. I don't need no doctor. I don't need no doctor. I don't need no doctor. I don't need no doctor. I don't need no doctor. I don't need no doctor. I don't need no doctor. I don't need no doctor
773,Darkness darkness. Be my pillow. Take me in and let me sleep. In the coolness of the shadow. In the silence of the deep. Darkness darkness. Hide my yearning for the things that cannot be. Keep my mind from constant turning. Towards the thing that cannot see. Thing that cannot see. Thing that cannot see.. Darkness darkness. Long and lonesome is the day that brings me everything. I have felt the edge of sorrow. I have known the depth of fear.. Darkness darkness. Be my blanket. Trouble me with your endless night. Take away take away take away the pain of knowing. Fill the emptiness with bright. Emptiness with bright. Emptiness with bright. Darkness darkness. Be my blanket. Take me in and cover me. Take away take away take away the pain of knowing. Fill the emptiness with bright. Emptiness with bright. Emptiness with bright. Emptiness loneliness. Take away. Emptiness loneliness. Take away. My sorrow. (Levinger).

788,Here we go. Holding onto lies holding onto ties that vanished. Cut the rope. And fall into the sky the devil filled our minds with sadness. The world's a gun and I've been aiming all my life. Got something to live for I know that I won't surrender. A warrior of youth. I'm taking over a shot to the new world order. I am Bulletproof. Here I go. Another prison fight another perfect sky I damaged. Now I know. Just who created life and why I set my sights to save it. The world's a gun and I've been aiming all my life. Got something to live for I know that I won't surrender. A warrior of youth. I'm taking over a shot to the new world order. I am Bulletproof. And as they take their final breath I have built the truth. I'm taking over a shot to the new world order. I am Bulletproof.
790,Go ahead and throw it in my face. Remind me of each of my mistakes. Turn on me tell me I'm wrong that it's all my fault. I feel I'm losing control. Putting my fists through the wall. This is the place that I break I can't take anymore. I see the fear in your eyes. I'm frozen standing still in time. What would love do. What would love do. If it were here in this room standing between me and you. What would love do. What would love do. I broke down and fell to the floor. Said I can't do this anymore. I almost lost the one thing I could never lose. I felt completely disarmed. Naked stripped down to the heart. Humble and shaken its time to start healing these wounds. How do I break from this hell. It's time I start asking myself. What would love do. What would love do. If it were here in this room standing between me and you. What would love do. What would love do. It would look in my face and stop me from hurting you. That's what love would do. Its time to come out of the dark. And step into the light. When fear tries to tear us apart. And we're torn between two sides. What would love do. What would love do. It would look in my face and stop me from hurting you. What would love do. What would love do. If it were here in this room standing between me and you. What would love do. What would love do. It would look in my face and stop me from hurting you. That's what love would do

With a brush in my hand. I'm [gonn' know where this off?]. When I laugh she must smile. When I smile she must laugh. Is it possible that I'd go for a girl in my path?.

806,When the little bluebird. Who has never said a word. Starts to sing Spring. When the little bluebell. At the bottom of the dell. Starts to ring Ding dong Ding dong. When the little blue clerk. In the middle of his work. Starts a tune to the moon up above. It is nature that is all. Simply telling us to fall in love. And that's why birds do it bees do it. Even educated fleas do it. Let's do it let's fall in love. Cold Cape Cod clams 'gainst their wish do it. Even lazy jellyfish do it. Let's do it let's fall in love. I've heard that lizards and frogs do it. Layin' on a rock. They say that roosters do it. With a doodle and cock. Some Argentines without means do it. I hear even Boston beans do it. Let's do it let's fall in love. When the little bluebird. Who has never said a word. starts to sing Spring spring spring. When the little bluebell. At the bottom of the dell. Starts to ring Ding ding ding. When the little blue clerk. In the middle of his work. Starts a tune. The most refined lady bugs do it. When a gentleman calls. Moths in your rugs they do it. What's the use of moth balls. The chimpanzees in the zoos do it. Some courageous kangaroos do it. Let's do it let's fall in love. I'm sure sometimes on the sly you do it. Maybe even you and I might do it. Let's do it let's fall in love

814,I'm feeling older than my years I'm feeling pain inside my chest.. You know it's love that keeps me silent it's my silence you detest.. Rivers flow into the ocean and oceans never fill. I want to kiss your lips but I know I never will.. Love's a hard decision to risk impending choke. So my love will keep you wishing. and my heart will keep me broke.. I give you flowers give you candy to even out the guilt.. I send you greeting cards with messages that I could never write.. Rivers flow into the oceans and oceans never fill. I want to let you know me but I know I never will.. Love's a contradiction made of mirrors and smoke. So my love will keep you wishing. And my heart it makes me broke.. You will always want me and I'll always want to leave.. Even though I cut your wounds you still deny they're real.. Rivers flow into the oceans and oceans never fill. I want to lay my life down but I know you never will.. Love's a strange condition with all the doubts it can invoke. Your love keeps me wishing and my heart it keeps me broke.. Baby don't you cry 'cause I got it all figure out.. You'll always make me sad but that's what true love is all about.. Rivers never fill the oceans but oceans always feel.... The waters reaching deep inside them I guess they always will.. Loves a constant mission truer words were never spoke. So my love will keep you wishin' and my heart will keep me broke.... ..keeps me wishing my heart it makes me broke....mirrors and smoke.

817,Honor salute and speak. To the corner standing flag. Do you remember how the days of school were. Indivisible separate worlds. Compare contrast. These dreams absurd. Placid classroom faces. Breathe in the features. Of a demographics death map trilogy. Children read them well. Not to bury 3 of 4 sons. As the likes of chivalry. Not to take 6 of 30 bills. To manufacture Corpus Christi. And so you think it can be so serene. History's most intolerable famine. Has clutched our global tranquility. Reaped the lives of children. Maladies collaborate. With cyclic despair. Infanticide clamors to 20 times more. In 4th and 5th Worlds. The poor have always been. Beside us. Amid us. Death has always been. As million cease 15 million that's an annual reap. Add divide multiply sum 41 thousand!

But I know you must have your reasons. There's tears in your eyes. I watch as you cry. But it's getting late. Was I invading in on your secrets. Was I too close for comfort. You're pushing me out. When I'm wanting in. What was I just about to discover. When I got too close for comfort. And driving you home. Guess I'll never know. Remember when we scratched our names into the sand. And told me you loved me. And now that I find. That you've changed your mind. I'm lost the words. And everything I feel for you. I wrote down on one piece of paper. The one in your hand.

He was in Dallas town. He was in Dallas town. Form a sixth floor window. A gunner shot him down. He died in Dallas town. He never knew my name. He never knew my name. Though I never met him. I knew him just the same. Oh he was a friend of mine.

I've exchanged my childhood dreams. for a bunch of make-believes. Touch the button. you should sit and listen. Watching as a tear. rains in to a broken heart.

837,"Nice girl stabs one with a defect. cellophane shrink-wrapped so correct.. Red dogs under illegal legs.. She looks so good that he gets down and begs.. She is watching the detectives.. ""ooh he's so cute!"". She is watching the detectives. when they shoot shoot shoot shoot.. They beat him up until the teardrops start. but he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart.. Long shot of that jumping sign. Visible shivers running down my spine.. Cut the baby taking off her clothes.. Close-up of the sign that says""We never close"". You snatch a chew an you a match a cigarette. She pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet.. I don't know how much more of this I can take.. She's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake.. chorus. You think you're alone until you realize you're in it.. Now fear is here to stay. Love is here for a visit.. They call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit.. Someone's scratching at the window. I wonder who is it?. The detectives come to check if you belong to the parents. who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance.. So it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay. it only took my little fingers to blow you away.. Just like watching the detectives.. Don't get cute!"". It's just like watching the detectives.. I get so angry when the teardrops start. but he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart.. Watching the detectives.. It's just like watching the detectives.."

841,Morning prayers took the girl unawares. She was late for class and she knew it. The broadcaster had a voice that was soothing. She couldn’t tell if it was a man or woman. A patch of sun fell onto her desk. She put her head on her arms on her neck. The lesson today was Acts of Apostles. The crazy hippies they’re running scared. She shut her eyes and imagined the desert. No cars no mobiles just sun and bread. What would she look like standing by the well?. More like a women and less like a girl. “Oh if I could make sense of it all!. I wish that I could sing. I’d stay in a melody. I would float along in my everlasting song. What would I do to believe?”. Later on she plays Morning Has Broken. She knows she’s bad. She is slowing everbody down. The choirmaster usually a bastard knows her mother’s sick. He’ll be nice to her. She thinks that she shouldn’t be there at all. Her worries make everything else seem trivial. “Oh if I could make sense of it all!. I wish that I could sing. I’d stay in a melody. I would float along in my everlasting song. What would I do to believe?”
842,Running out of breath. Chasing down the big parade. Rising up my hand. Thought I'd beg the marching band to play for me. All of these illusions. They really mean the world to me me. Don't make me out to be this helpless child of misery. Maybe love is what I need. But not your sympathy. In and out of space. I'm always somewhere in between. I try to make commands. But instead I make a mess of things for me. I try paint by numbers. But nothing's black and white to me. Don't make me out to be this helpless child of misery. Maybe love is what I need. But not your sympathy. Nothing and no one can make your lies the truth and no one can stand inside your shoes but you. Don't make me out to be this helpless child misery. Maybe love is what I need. But not your sympathy. But not your sympathy
843,Come be my April Fool. Come you're the only one. Come on your rusted bike. Come we'll break all the rules. We'll ride like writers ride. Neither rich nor broke. We'll race through alleyways. In our tattered cloaks so. Come be my April Fool. Come we'll break all the rules. We'll burn all of our poems. Add to God's debris. We'll pray to all of our saints. Icons of mystery. We'll tramp through the mire. When our souls feel dead. With laughter we'll inspire. Then back to life again. Come you're the only one. Come be my April Fool. Come come. Be my April Fool. We'll break all the rules
844,A trail of tears beyond redemption. Just a word and nothing more. No more. I must reveal I am falling. To the dark. I now am born. So if you hear this cry. Show me a sign. Give me meaning. Lead me to life. Let me know. Why all the lies I'm believing. Have led me so far. Far from home. Gutting (?) anguish not forgotten. Eternal life will not be mine tonight. But if I wake to find perdition. At least I know. The fault was mine. At least I know. The fault was mine. So if you hear this cry. Show me a sign. Give me meaning. Lead me to life. Let me know. Why all the lies I'm believing. Have led me so far. Far from home. When (?) the fire inside is gone. And all that I once had is lost. To the darkness I am born. A trail of tears beyond redemption. Just a word and nothing more. I must reveal that I'm falling. To the dark I am born. Show me a sign. Give me meaning. Lead me to life. Let me know. Why all the lies I'm believing. Have led me so far. Far from home. Ohh. Ohh
845,"I am the heartache you built by your deception. A blind leap of faith despair for passing seasons. Sink in Anger fountains forming. Spills like thunder to what we're holding. Sleep forever now my darling. I won't dwell on Heaven's Calling. Drive into the stake secrets of his ""compassion"". A perfect escape like hell you'll list your reasons. Sink in Anger fountains forming. Spills like thunder to what we're holding. Sleep forever now my darling. I won't dwell on Heaven's Calling. Sink in Anger fountains forming. Spills like thunder to what we're holding. Sleep forever now my darling. I won't dwell on Heaven's Calling"

I can't believe what's happening. I don't know what to say. I can't believe I left to see this day. I don't wanna live this way it haunts my mind. And I just need to get it straight. Stop wasting time. And I don't wanna live in fear. But I can change what's wrong. But I know we'll be living in a lie. Oh I'll be hanging on the cross. When I put the nails in. It's time to choose a road that we believe in. You say you understand it all try and smile. If only I could see it's true somehow. You can't believe what's happening. I don't know what to say. And what I wouldn't give to change our fate. I don't wanna live this way it haunts my mind. And I just need to get it straight. Stop wasting time. And I don't wanna live in fear. But I can change what's wrong. But I know won't be living in a lie. And I've tried so hard to hold on. But I keep on falling. And no matter how hard I run. I just keep returning. And I'm back to where I started from. I don't wanna live this way it haunts my mind. And I just need to get it straight. Stop wasting time. I don't wanna live this way it haunts my mind. And I just need to get it straight. Stop wasting time. And I don't wanna live in fear. But I can change what's wrong. But I know won't be living in a lie

888,I'm coming apart at the seams.. Pitching myself for leads in other people's dreams.. Now buzz buzz buzz.. Doc there's a hole where something was.. Doc there's a hole where something was.. Fell out of bed.. Butterfly bandage. But don't worry.. You'll never remember. Your head is far too blurry.. Put him in the back of a squad car. Restrain that man. He needs his head put through a CAT scan.. Hey editor I'm undeniable. Hey Doctor I'm certifiable. I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine. What a match:. I'm half doomed and you're semi sweet. So boycott love. Detox just to retox. And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life. Imperfect boys with their perfect ploys. Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy. Little girl. You caught me staring odd. Or was that just a telescopic camera nod. Painted dolls in the highway truck stop stalls. Lot lizard scales cool your night life rules. All the rookies leave your badge and your gun on the desk when you leave the room. I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine. What a match:. I'm half doomed and you're semi sweet. Boycott love. Detox just to retox. And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life. Imperfect boys with their perfect ploys. Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy

Flipping through the pages all the many stages different ages. As time passes my. Life flashes right in front of me. Who'd have guessed the things were to come. From reflections of what used to be. It amazes me to see what has come of me. Still but yet in motion. Worth a thousand words. Or even millions more. [Chorus x2]

The tap-tap-tapping. Of the typewriter pays. The gentle rattling. Of the drays. Down all the days. I have often had to depend upon. The kindness of strangers. But I've never been asked. And I never replied. If I supported Glasgow Rangers. Down all the days. The tap-tap-tapping. Of the typewriter pays. The gentle rattling. Of the drays. Down all the days.
923,Though it's me that's on fire not this cigarette. I was stabbed in the back by that young suffragette. And what do I care if she leaves me alone. If I need somebody I'll pick up the phone. I'll put on my good face clean up the flat. I'm starting all over good bye to all that. Put on some music and pour out a drink. I'll go back to bed and I'll try not to think. Someone to talk to Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to Someone to talk to. She was a person I just couldn't see. And I tried to make her what she couldn't be. We tried and we tried but of course in the end. I drove her crazy and right 'round the bend. Now it's too much to just sit here and cry. I can't be seen with a tear in my eye. Why am I standing right next to the phone?. When I kept on saying I must be alone. Someone to talk to Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to Someone to talk to. I love you why didn't I say that before. I guess that it's safe now she's walked through the door. It's hard when you know that you've got to go on. Feeling so weak and pretending you're strong. I didn't see her I only felt me. And one day I'll learn just which part of me bleeds. Now that she's gone I know she was great. But I fucked it up and now it's too late. Someone to talk to Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to Someone to talk to. Por Nelson Portela
926,"Trans Am. The wagons in the valley had pulled up for the night. Seth said ""go get the plow out Merle this place looks just right"". By then they were surrounded by dawn they all were dead. I heard this from the old Trans Am up the road ahead. That cowboy just kept talking I thought I heard him say. He used to ride the Santa Fe before the tracks were laid. Trans Am. A nasty wind was blowing through the gates of Eden Park. One was swinging and one was hanging. and the street lights all were dark. It crawled along the boulevard with two wheels on the grass. That old Trans Am was dying hard but still had lots of gas. The golden gate was open wide the sun came shining through. Where once the angels stood and cried everything was new. Trans Am. Global manufacturing hands across the sea. The hotel filled with dealers everything was free. Before the competition ahead of all the rest. The product was presented it clearly was the best. The power link was ruptured the hotel shook and rolled. The old Trans Am just bounced around and took another road. Trans Am. An old friend showed up at the door. The mile posts flying by. He said come on I said what for. He said I'll show you why. I got a call from north of here. They said some girl's broke down. There's good money in it for you and me. If we can get her back to town. She's somewhere north of Barstow. Lost on 66. An old Trans Am by the side of the road. That needs a headlight fixed. Trans Am."

1000,"With a crooked smile and a heart-shaped face. Comes from the West country where the birds sing bass. She's got a house-big heart where we all live. And plead and council and forgive. Her widow's peak her lips I've kissed. Her glove of bones at her wrist. That I have held in my hand. Her Spanish fly and her monkey gland. Her Godly body and its fourteen stations. That I have embraced her palpitations. Her unborn baby crying ""Mummy"". Amongst the rubble of her body. Her lovely lidded eyes I've sipped. Her fingernails all pink and chipped. Her accent which I'm told is ""broad"". That I have heard and has been poured. Into my human heart and filled me. With love up to the brim and killed me. And rebuilt me back anew. With something to look forward to. Well who could ask much more than that?. A West country girl with a big fat cat. That looks into her eyes of green."

Time to get it. Before you let it. Get to you. Here he comes now. Stick to your guns. And let him through. Everybody's coming from the winter vacation. Taking in the sun in a exaltation to you. You come running in on platform shoes. With Marshall stacks. To at least just give us a clue. Ah here it comes. I know it's someone I knew. Teenage riot in a public station. Gonna fight and tear it up in a hypernation for you. Now I see it. I think I'll leave it out of the way. Now I come near you. And it's not clear why you fade away. Looking for a ride to your secret location. Where the kids are setting up. A free-speed nation for you. Got a foghorn and a drum and a hammer. That's rockin'. And a cord and a pedal and a lock. That'll do me for now. It better work out. I hope it works out my way. 'Cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city's head. Takes a teen age riot. To get me out of bed right now. You better look it.

So who's to take the blame for the stormy weather. You're never gonna stop. All the teenage leather and booze. It's time to go round. A one man showdown. Teach us how to fail. We're off the streets now. And back on the road. On the riot trail

1016,I request that the best of our minds. Be impressed to repent of their crimes. For the truth is there all for to see. What can be said in defence of man's tyranny. To declare to contempt of the view. That to conform to the norm is what you do. If you live wracked in anger and in shame. The only road you find's that hard road my friend. I concur to defer to the sound. Of discontent when it's meant by the crowd. If in fairness is how you see it end. The only road you'll walk's that hard road my friend. And the papers they were printing they did sell. In Clerkenwell there were presses turning. And the emigrees they boarded ships and sailed. They could not fail to bring passions burning. La da da da-da. Why deny that the lie that is sent. Makes you live work and die for some rent. If you're happy then to leave it up to them. The only road you'll know's that hard road my friend. We resent the intent of the few. Who do conspire to acquire what's our due. If you don't know you're rights and defend. The only road you'll goes that hard road my friend. If you fall and you crawl towards debt. And the sum it is more than what was leant. If you can't keep your eyes on the change. The only road you'll walk's that bloody road my friend. Ah yip da didi didi dee. Ah yip da didi didi dee. Ah yip da didi didi dee. Ah yip da didi didi dee

Brown skinned Indian on the banks. That were crowded and narrow. Held a broken arrow?. Eighteen years of American dream. He saw that his brother had sworn on the wall.. He hung up his eyelids and ran down the hall. His mother had told him a trip was a fall. And don't mention babies at all.. Did you see him did you see him?. Did you see him in the river?. He was there to wave to you.. Could you tell that the empty quivered. Brown skinned Indian on the banks. That were crowded and narrow. Held a broken arrow?. The streets were lined for the wedding parade. The Queen wore the white gloves the county of song. The black covered caisson her horses had drawn. Protected her King from the sun rays of dawn.. They married for peace and were gone.. Did you see them did you see them?. Did you see them in the river?. They were there to wave to you.. Could you tell that the empty quivered. Brown skinned Indian on the banks. That were crowded and narrow. Held a broken arrow?.

1035,"In the middle of the night. In the middle of a lonely night. Stands alone in the pale moonlight. Screams out in defiance. He's got no one to turn to. You could talk til you turn blue. He'd just turn his back on you. Ain't no compromising. Cause he's totally untamed. No fear of the unnamed. But he'll take the blame. Cause someone's gotta do it. Now he's out on the highway. He's got the key and the right of way. His tank is full and his toll's paid. Hellbound and determined. He run a dangerous payload. When he comes to the crossroads. Ah man it's all times to explode. You'll just see the sky burnin'. Now he's standin' at hell's door. With a bad attitude and a forty-four. The devil said "";What's up man. Now what you come here for?"";. He said "";Man let's just get to it"";. He said "";I always heard that you were the bad one. There's a few places I ain't been a few things I ain't done. You got your pitchfork and I got my gun"";. Someone's gotta do it"

1052,Watching the ice melt between us. Just faster than grass grows. ItÃ­s not the best that weÃ­ve seen us. But nothing else I'd have chose. Reminds me of a time. When anything could have come. Anything could have happened. What a fantastic feeling. Time is precious as you say it is. I wanna know that we didn't miss. It goes by quickly youÃ­ll soon find out. I wonÃ­t go down. Time is precious as you say it is. I wanna know that we didnÃ­t miss. It goes by quickly youÃ­ll soon find out. When you fight to resist. Emotion with a fist. An irresistible force will always. Prevail. The fortress goes crumbling down. Around you where you stand. What was once strong mortar. Is now a pile of sand. Time is just as precious as you say it is. I wanna spend it and know that we didn't miss. I've dodged so many bullets that IÃ­m careful now. I wonÃ­t go down. Time is just as precious as you say it is. I wanna spend it and know that we didn't miss. I've dodged so many bullets that I'm careful now. From reckless to recluse. And sometimes back again. Left wondering what's the use. Of a life of mischief spent. Makes cool the desert sun. The piece of mind that you gave me. Absolve me for things I've done. Only that can save me. Time is just as precious as you say it is. I wanna spend it and know that we didn't miss. I've dodged so many bullets that I'm careful now. I wonÃ­t go down. Time is just as precious as you say it is. I wanna spend it and know that we didnÃ­t miss. IÃ­ve dodged so many bullets that IÃ­m careful now.

(I got body control I-I I said I got body control).. Lyrics by: Gia
1054,"Erik wrote: ""The theme is similar to the Nick's song New Morning. Note also that the line 'There'll be no sadness no sorrow' also is in New Morning. Finally the bright day versus black night antithesis is also the same.. Well I'm tired and so weary but I must go along. Till the Lord comes and calls calls me away oh yes. And the mornin's so bright and the lamb is the light. And the night night is as black as the sea oh yes.. CHORUS. . There will be peace in the valley for me some day. There will be peace in the valley for me dear Lord I pray.. There'll be no sadness no sorrow no trouble I see. There will be peace in the valley for me.. The bear will be gentle and the wolf will be tame. And the lion shall lie down with the lamb that's what it. says And the beasts from the wild will be led by a child. And I will be changed changed from this creature that I am oh yes.."
1055,It's been a long dark lonely hall. Between the cracks I can read the scrawl. It's written down in a crooked rhyme. That sold me out before my time. You know but since then I been back down to the edge. I can't believe the things you never said. I can't explain the words I never found. My whole world should come crashing down. You know but you can't sell me out with everything you think about. I think back I draw a blank. You know but there ain't no need to dig the past. You know I I don't wanna live my life in a day. I ain't got no need for this plastic cage. 'Cause you don't think about anything I think about. You know what I mean. Now you know for sure you're alive. Because you watched her leave before your eyes. You know I'm afraid to say your name. But I ain't afraid to share this blame. Because you can't sell me out everything you think about. You know what I mean. It's been a long dark lonely hall. Between the cracks I can read the scrawl. Find a place that feels like home. You know I I get some clue to where I'm going. You know you don't think about anything I think about. You know what I mean. You know what I mean oh no. You know what I mean.
1056,It was three in the morning when she took me apart. She wrecked the furniture she wrecked my heart. She danced on my head like Arthur Murray. The scars ain't never going to mend in a hurry. Just when I thought I could learn to forget her. Right through the door come a tear-stained letter. Oh oh oh love love. Cry cry if it makes you feel better. Set it all down in a tear-stained letter. Oh oh oh love love love. Cry cry if it makes you feel better. Set it all down in a tear-stained letter. Well my head was beating like a song by the Clash. It was writing cheques that my body couldn't cash. Got to my feet I was reeling and dizzy. I went for the 'phone but the line was busy. Just when I thought that things would get better. Right through the door come a tear-stained letter. Oh oh oh love love. Cry cry if it makes you feel better. Set it all down in a tear-stained letter. Oh oh oh love love love love. Cry cry if it makes you feel better. Set it all down in a tear-stained letter. Well I like coffee and I like tea. But I just don't like this fiddle-di-dee. It makes me nervous it gives me the hives. Waiting for a kiss from a bunch of fives. Just when I think I could learn to forget her. Right through the door come a tear-stained letter. Oh oh oh love love love. Cry cry if it makes you feel better. Set it all down in a tear-stained letter. Oh oh oh love love. Cry cry if it makes you feel better. Set it all down in a tear-stained letter. Oh oh oh. Cry cry if it makes you feel better. Set it all down in a tear-stained letter

1058,As I cough out fire. You're lighting up. And you burn me with every maybe. And I cut the chords and I break the locks. But I'm powerless in your slavery. And I curse this hell. And I hate your guts. And I swear I will pay for this craving never again. But we'll be making love like savages. I'll lick the poison from right off your kiss. Fall on rosy thorns for a taste of lethal bliss. Oh we'll be making love like savages. Savages. Savages. As I choke on flames. You light up your torch. Each of my defeats is your victory. And I walk barefoot on a field of swords. You have mastered the art of cruelty. And I curse this hell. And I hate your guts. And I swear I'll dance with the devil never again. But we'll be making love like savages. I'll lick the poison from right off your kiss. Fall on rosy thorns for a taste of lethal bliss. Oh we'll be making love like savages. Savages. Savages. Savages. Savages
1060,I know I stand in line until you think. You have the time to spend an evening with me. And if we go someplace to dance. I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me. And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place. And have a drink or two....... And then I go and spoil it all by saying. Something stupid like I love you. I can see it in your eyes that you despise. The same old lines you heard the night before....... And though it's just a lie to you for me it's true....... And never seemed so right before. I practice every day to find some clever lines. To say to make the meaning come true....... But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late. And I'm alone with you. The time is right your perfume fills my head....... The stars get red and oh the night's so blue....... And then I go and spoil it all by saying. Something stupid like I love you
1062,(Rafferty/Egan). I can look out my window. Or stare at the wall. It really didn't matter. Na I just didn't care at all. Could be sitting by the water. Counting every stone. But nothing means nothing. When your empty and on your own. Cause you put something better. Inside of me. You put something better. Inside of me. Makes me so much stronger. I'm amazed at the change in me. Well I knew what I was doing. I was running away. Busy going nowhere. Just wasting the time of day. I was walking down the road. Kicking at the stones. Nothing means nothing. When your empty and on your own. Know why?. You put something better inside of me. Makes me so much stronger. I'm amazed at the change in me. You put something better inside of me. Makes me so much stronger. I'm amazed at the change in me. You made me so much stronger. I'm amazed at the change in me. Take me home.

Too long in exile my friend. You can never go home again. Well that isolated feeling. Drives you so close up against the wall. Till you feel like you can't go on. You've been in the same place for too long. Too long in exile. Baby you can never go back home. Too long in exile. Anyway you want. Oh that isolated feeling. Drives you up against up against the wall. 'Cos you've been on the mainland baby. Been on the mainland comin'on strong. Too long in exile. Too long people keep hanging on. Too long in exile.

Hey boy when you line the track a lack a. Hey boy dontcha line the track. OOO my love came tumblin’ down. OOO love come tumblin’ down. OOO (Let’s get outta here). Love come tumblin’.

Dontcha line the track a lack a. Oh boy dontcha line the track. Oh boy dontcha line the track. OOO my love came tumblin’ down. OOO love come tumblin’ down. OOO love come tumblin’. Poor boy sweatin’ in the hot summer night. Hangman waitin’ for the early mornin’ light. Singin’ Oh boy dontcha line the track a lack a. Oh boy dontcha line the track a lack a. Oh boy dontcha line the track. If I could I surely would. Stand on the rock that Moses done stood. Singin’ O boy dontcha line the track a lack a. O boy dontcha line the track. Oh boy dontcha line the track a lack a. Oh boy don’t ya line the track.

1068,What can I do. It's gotten me beaten black and blue. Why don't you know. You got me moving much too slow. Why can't you see. You got me chasing honey bees. You made me fall. Broke me up and took it all. Call me your messed up boy. Just what I've found. You knock my body to the ground. Just what I've said. You're tearing up my weary head. Do I still shine. After such a lonely time. You cut me dead. You nail me down and kick my head. Cut dead your messed up boy. hey hey hey. hey hey hey. hey hey hey
1071,Stealing glances through the key hole. In a brick wall's wooden door. Changes are keeping quite secrets. Two hundred year old folklore. And the graveyard on Elizabeth. No one ever goes. Kneeling praying to a gravestone. But the gravestone never tells. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. December crossing on to Chinatown. As the wind starts to cut through. Always always on the lookout. But the poisons running through you. Stomachaches try to concentrate. Want the stairs on the third floor. Now I'm asking a witch doctor. But the witch doctor won't tell. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. Floating on the sea stars are watching me. Current takes me out what will be will be. Floating on the sea stars are watching me. Current takes me out what will be will be. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. Hear the bells
1075,You work like a dog 5 days a week. It sounds bleak. And you feel it's never gonna end. I recommend. That you chill for a sec. Take a deep breath. And think about the weekend. Where you are going to. What you gonna do. You spend 5 days dying. Now live it up for 2. I'm talkin' friday saturday. Nothin' really matter day. Take it to the limit and recover on sunday!. Paycheck cashed no responsibility. Free to lose your mind and enjoy the insanity. Time to be lazy. Time to get crazy. Monday morning comes it'll all be hazy. What I say?. No price to pay. From a pawn to a player. And an all night sprayer. Going hard you're the man. Give yourself a big hand. Made it through the week. Now it's off to the promise land. Come on come on everybody. Let's get together and party. Let's start this party right. Gonna lose your minds tonight. Looking all around the world. Calling all my dogs and girls. If you feel it sing along. Gonna party all night. Now it's time to shine. Let them see how it's done. You need to show the people. What it means to have fun. Get up on the table. If you're willing and able. Prove to everybody that you're mentally unstable. No room for that here. Leave your problems at the door. Let your hair down. Get out on the dancefloor. Nobody staring. Ain't nobody caring. Can't hear anyway. Cause the music is blaring. Now the party's rockin'. And there ain't no stoppin'. And to keep it jumpin'. We need the music pumpin'. Let's get this party started. We'll let you get retarted. We only want to play. So where my dogs at?. Where my girls at?. C'mon c'mon everybody!
1076,This is New York yo. Night falls on the city. Finds me all alone. Makes me wonder. Should I just go on home. And I walk up the stairs. To see if you're sill there. Would you mind if. I found you alone. Then a cold wind came callin'. Strange how it knew it'd bother me. See the night would fade. But the pain's gonna stay. Makes me wonder. Have you ever made love to me. I can't stop the rain here it comes again. Lightnin' strikes across the sky. Oh I can't stop the rain here it comes again. Lightnin' only blinds my eyes. Ain't it sad. When the only love I ever had. Just slips away. Right through my fingers. Ain't it a shame when I think of your name. The only memory I have is it. I can't stop the rain here it comes again. Lightnin' strikes across the sky. Oh I can't stop the rain here it comes again. It takes a witch to curse that goddamn sky. I can't stop the rain here it comes again. Lightnin' strikes across the sky. Oh I can't stop the rain here it comes again. 'Cause lightnin' only blinds my eyes. Oh I can't stop the rain here it comes again. 'Cause lightnin' only blinds my eyes. Can't stop it blinds my eyes.
1077,You walked out on your best. But you knew they would never pass the test. They mess your life around. But your life's taking their life. Taking them down. And you never give it up.

1078,One day I'll be gone. The world will keep turning. I hope I leave this place. Better than I found it. Oh it's hard I know it's hard. To be the lightning in the dark. Hold on tight you'll be alright. You know it's time. Here comes the change. We're comin' of age. This is not a phase. Here comes here comes the change. Is it a crazy thought?. That if I had a child.

1086,sung by William. The way you drop is like a stone. Making out you're flying. But you've just been thrown. Till kingdom comes. And through bitten tongues. These eyes get stung. With every curse that's sung. These twisted times. Can't compare to mine. And heaven knows where loving goes. I should have guessed. When I took that pill. Do I love her still. Well did Jesus kill.
1087,Well the night was deep and the night was dark. And I was at the old dance-hall on the edge of town. Some big ceremony was going down. Dancers writhed and squirmed and then. Came apart and then writhed again. Like squirming flies on a pin. In the heat and in the din. Yes in the heat and in the din. I fell to thinking about brand new wife of mad John Finn. Well midnite came and clock did strike. And in she came did John Finn's wife. With legs like scissors and butcher's knives. A tattooed breast and flaming eyes. And a crimson carnation in her teeth. Carving her way through the dance floor. And I'm standing over by the bandstand. Every eye gaping on John Finn's wife. Yeah every eye gaping on John Finn's wife. Now John Finn's wife was something of a mystery. In a town where to share a sworn secret was a solemn duty. I had brass knuckles and a bolo knife. Over near the bandstand with John Finn's wife. She got perfumed breasts and raven hair. Sprinkled with wedding confettis. And a gang of garrotters were all giving me stares. Armed as they were with machetes. And the night through the window was full of lights. Winking and awatching at John Finns' wife. Winking and awatching at John Finns' wife. Next came the cops all out on the town. But it don't look like no trouble there. As they head for the bar in their lumpy suits. And I slip my hand between the thighs of John Finn's wife. And they seemed to yawn awake her things. It was a warm and very ferocious night. The moon full of blood and light. And my eyes grew small and my eyes grew tight. As I plotted in the ear of John Finns' wife. Enter John Finn in his shrunken suit. With his quick black eyes and black.
1088,I built a house of cards. Built a house of rain. Built a house of love. It's hard to build again. Built a road to reason. Built a road to fate. Built a road to the promised land. Right up to the gate. Loose change in my pocket. Future in my hand. Too many distractions. For me to understand. Too many distractions. Got to get back home. Get into something solid. Get out of the zone. Some roads bring renewal. Some roads hide and wait. Some roads promise everything. And steal your fuel away. Loose change in my pocket. Future in my hand. Too many distractions. For me to understand. Some roads I been flyin'. Some roads I crashed. Some roads I been sleepin' on. Some roads I got back. Some roads I been runnin'. Some roads I was stopped. Some roads I been walkin down. Some roads I was lost.

You disappoint me; i see right through. How can i love if i hate all of you?. You speak your visions; i see right through. Your false intentions; far from the truth. Your taste is precious. But your heart is growing cold again. The spell is tempting but your wishes seem to fold again. (your wishes seem to fold again). I've always wanted someone like you. How can i love if i hate all of you?. You disappoint me; i see right through. How can i love if i hate all of you?. My heart is coming down now. But i'm not starting over. I can't wait a moment longer. I've done the best i can. I've always wanted someone like you. How can i love if i hate all of you?. You disappoint me i see right through. How can i love if i hate all of you?
1110,I try to face the fight within. But it's over. I'm ready for the riot to begin. And surrender. I walked the path that led me to the end. Remember. I'm caught beneath with nothing left to give. Forever. (Chorus). When angels fall with broken wings. I can't give up I can't give in. When all is lost and daylight ends. I'll carry you and we will live forever. Forever. Grey skies will chase the light away. No longer. I fought the fight now only dark remains. Forever. Divided I will stand and I will let this end. (Chorus). When angels fall with broken wings. I can't give up I can't give in. When all is lost and daylight ends. I'll carry you and we will live forever. Forever. The sun begins to rise. And wash away the sky. The turning of the tide. Don't leave it all behind. And I will never say goodbye. When angels fall with broken wings. I can't give up I can't give in. When all is lost and daylight ends. I'll carry you and we will live forever. Forever x3
1112,(B.O.Y B.O.Y.). Doesn't really matter what you say. Nothing's gonna stand in my way. Waiting for the truth to come out. And I just don't know how. I need you from the first kiss. You know I just can help it. Can you be my witness?. Cause I still.... Refrão. Needing this boy. Breaking my heart. Taking my money. Tearing me apart. Needing this boy. Breaking me down. Using my love whenever he's around. Doesn't really matter what he does. Does he know he is getting my love?. Waiting for all to fall apart. Cause he is breaking my heart. I need him from the first kiss. You know I just can't have this. Can you be my witness?. I'm going crazy. Refrão 2x. Needing this boy. Breaking my heart. Taking my money. Tearing me apart. Needing this boy. Breaking me down. Using my love whenever he's around. (B.O.Y. B.O.Y. B.O.Y. B.O.Y.). Doesn't need this boy. Doesn't need this boy. Breaking my heart. Taking my money. Tearing me apart. Needing this boy. Breaking me down. Using my love whenever he's around. Doesn't need this boy. Breaking my heart. Taking my money. Tearing me apart. Needing this boy. Breaking me down. Using my love whenever he's around. (B.O.Y. B.O.Y. B.O.Y. B.O.Y.)
1113,When you and I are ready no longer earthly-bound. We'll travel through the crystal night starbound. Heaven holds a mystery wrapped inside a sound. Through the eyes of time starbound you and I. A floating star is what we are. Suspended in space. Outward-bound it's the only home we've found. To save the human race. Speed is now their captain kings that lost their crown. Motion is our master. Starbound. Starbound. Starbound

1115,I stand accused. Just like you for being born without a silver spoon. Stood at the top of a hill. Over my town I was found. I've been on the shelf too long. Sitting at home on my bed too long. Got my things and now I'm gone. How's the world gonna take me?. Finding myself used to be hard. But now I see the light. If love is a drug. Then I don't need it. I've been on the shelf too long. Sitting at home on my bed too long. Now it's time to hear my song. How are you gonna take it?. I've been on the shelf too long. I've got a lot of living to do. There's a door in my mind that's open wide. Come inside come inside. Jesus never saved me. He'll never save you too and you know!. I've got a little sticker on the back of my boot. This is music. And now I see the light shining bright in my eyes. If love is the drug then it ain't for me. Well music is my life. And loved by me. I'm gonna move on the floor with my sweet young thing. Down down down we go till we reach the bottom. Of our soul with this is music

1124,By the end of the bout he was punched out. Fists capsized muscles shouting. Deeper down. He felt the insult of a kiss. Deeper still than we can go. Further out than triremes row. Drowning slow. His memories persist. Out beyond the telescope’s pry. Up above the tallest Dutch dope high. He realized. This mystery is his. Underneath the ocean floor. A part of who we are we don’t explore. I adore. The meaninglessness of the this. We can’t express. By the end of the bout he was punched out. Fists capsized muscles shouting. Deeper down. He felt the comfort of a kiss

1155,If you're part of my love. Don't leave home tonight. While we're sleeping we can learn to see that. All the world's a tiny bubble. Floating inside. Those of us who notice are. Expected to hide. All the world's a tiny bubble. Floating inside the truth. When I look in your eyes. I can see the sky. Shining down upon the perfect garden. All the world's a tiny bubble. Floating inside. Those of us who notice are. Expected to hide. All the world's a tiny bubble. Floating inside the truth. You can't imagine just what I've been going through. I wouldn't wish it on a soul much less on you. I well remember when my heart was free. My soul could laugh so could we. If you're part of my love. Don't leave home tonight. While we're sleeping we can learn to see that. All the world's a tiny bubble. Floating inside. Those of us who notice are. Expected to hide. All the world's a tiny bubble. Floating inside the truth. You can't imagine just what I've been going through. I wouldn't wish it on a soul much less on you. I well remember when my soul was free. My heart could sing so could we. If you're part of my love. You won't leave home tonight. While we're sleeping we can learn to see that. All the world's a tiny bubble. Floating inside. All the world's a tiny bubble. Floating inside. All the world's a tiny bubble.
1156,And so she woke up. Woke up from where she was lyin' still.. Said I gotta do something. About where we're goin'.. Step on a steam train. Step out of the driving rain maybe. Run from the darkness in the night.. Singing ah ah la la la de day. Ah la la la de day.. Sweet the sin bitter the taste in my mouth.. I see seven towers but I only see one way out.. You gotta cry without weeping. talk without speaking. Scream without raising your voice.. You know I took the poison from the poison stream. Then I floated out of here singing. Ah la la la de day. Ah la la la de day.. She walks through the streets. With her eyes painted red. Under black belly of cloud in the rain.. In through a doorway. She brings me white golden pearls. Stolen from the sea.. She is ragin'. She is ragin'. And the storm blows up in her eyes.. She will suffer the needle chill. She's running to stand still.

1159,Spiders are singing in the salty breeze. Spiders are filling out tax returns. Spinning out webs of deductions and melodies. On a private beach in Michigan. Why can't they wish their kisses good. Why do they miss when their kisses should. Fly like winging birds fighting for the keys. On a private beach in Michigan. This recent rash of kidsmoke. All these telescopic poems. It's good to be alone. Why can't they say what they want. Why can't they just say what they mean. Come clean listen and talk. Hello private callers IDs blocked. The sun will rise we'll climb into cars. The future has a valley and a shortcut around. Who will wear the crown of drowning award. Hold a private light on a Michigan shore. You fool me with a kiss of kidsmoke. From a microscopic home. It's good to be alone. I'll be in my bed. You can be the stone. That raises from the dead. And carries us all home. There's no blood on my hands. I just do as I am told
1163,Legs up to her shoulders. All the way back down. She's not playin' she knows what she's doin'. And the word's out on the town. She wanna be a cheerleader. A cheerleader. She got the moves. She got the grooves. All the boys need her. Oh oh that's the way she wants to be. Cruisin' the touch line at a quarter to three. See her ?she wanna be a cheerleader. Now shes gettin' bolder. Now she gets around. She's not takin no for an answer. She's not getting down. She's a no teaser. A no pleaser. She got the drive. She got the jive. She's a big squeezer. Oh oh that's all she wants to be. Shake a little tush for the boys to see. Wanna be her ?a cheerleader. But what she wants the most. To be the perfect host. She wants to play the field all over. She needs it most of all. When it's too close to call. She wants to rock and roll all over. Yes all over. Legs up to her shoulders. All the way back down. She's not playin' she knows what she's doin'. The word's out on the town. She wanna be a cheerleader. A cheerleader. She got the moves. She got the grooves. All the boys need her. Oh oh that's all she wants to be. Shake a little tush for the boys to see. Wanna be her ?a cheerleader. Oh oh that's all she wants to be. Cruisin' the touch line at a quarter to three. See her ?she wanna be a cheerleader.
1165,Oh I used to be your baby. Used to be your pride and joy. Mmm You used to take me dancing. Just like any other boy. But now you've found another partner. And left me like a broken toy. Oh it's someone else you're taking. Someone else you're playin' to. Honey though I'm aching. Know just what I have to do. If I can't have you when I'm wakin'. I'll go to sleep and dream I'm with you. Oh take me take me take me. To the dreamer's ball. Mmm I'll be right on time and I'll dress so fine. You're gonna love me when you see me. I won't have to worry. Take me take me. Promise not to wake me till it's morning. It's all been true. What do you say about that then honey ?. Are you gonna take me to that dreamer's ball ?. I'd like that. Right on that forty second street. Way down down town we must go. Oh take me take me take me. I'm your plaything now. You make my life worthwhile with the slightest smile. Or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper. Gently take me remember I'll be dreamin' of my baby. At the dreamer's ball. Oh take me hold me. Remember what you told me. You'd meet me at the dreamer's ball. I'll meet you at the dreamer's ball. Ooh
1168,"Headline in the paper tells of fighting in the streets. Teenage battles; six arrested. Mutters in the council chambers something must be done. Before our city streets become infested. And mummy turns to daddy says ""where was our little boy that day. Why can't he just stay at home and watch the silver screen"". Ch: All we wanted was a cause that we could fight for. One chance for the heroes to win the day. All we wanted was a chance to see the world. In black and white instead of a hundred shades of grey. Watch the raving maniacs go carving up the night. See the barmy smiles on their faces. See the crazy bombers going cross their deadly wires. Blow themselves into a million pieces. The bands play it hard and fast go ripping through their sets. Adrenaline going flowing drink and no regrets. What do we tell our grandchildren. When they ask us about the good old days. Boring empty daytime jobs and frozen up inside. Do you not remember what your daddy told you long ago."
1171,"Oil In My Lamp (Gene Parsons/Clarence White). . Give me oil in my lamp. Keep me burning burning burnin. Give me oil in my lamp as I pray. Give me oil in my lamp. Keep me burnin' burnin' burnin'. Keep me burnin' till I burn away. Sing oh sinner sing oh sinner. Sing oh sinner to the king. Sing oh sinner sing oh sinner. Sing oh sinner to the king. .

1174,Now I'm in a band people try to make me do things. Kiss arses and pay tribute. But I'm inclined today to do those things anyway. And I don't care who hears it. 'Cause I'm a fan of the Go-Betweens. A fan of Robert and I always have been. But I like Grant now that I've met him. Because he's charming. Of all the stars and all the would-be stars. I'd take him home to my mum and dad. Yeah he's charming but he's a trouble-maker too. He amuses me greatly. I like Lindy and I saw Vickers. Pete stole the set list and the itinerary. He wrote my name down as 'Tour Rent Boy'. It was hard but so is life. . I was making button badges. And I had too much time on my hands. I coloured them by hand. Pere Ubu and the Sugarcubes. Kids came in to watch me. But Pete & Sean just scorned. Just like they scorned Robert. But I secretly loved the big guy. He dressed like Sherlock Holmes. And he fixed us with a quizzative eye. Before singing such romances. That only the sods trampled underfoot by Thatcher. Could appreciate their love. Could appreciate their love
1178,By the grace of your lips. I have long searched happiness. And the love in our hearts. Shine away through the dark. But lately lately lately lately I. Have felt an overwhelming need to cry. And maybe maybe maybe we can try. To make it right oh to make it right. This is our break up song but. Can't we just get along for the night. Not fight one less goodbye. But just a moment let me hold back. Baby hold back all the things we haven't said. Make love like we just met. By the way. Let you kiss I know it's over yeah all of this. And the one world that we knew. Has broken in two. 'Cuz lately lately lately lately I. Have felt a kind of change I can't deny. And baby baby baby if we try. We make it right yeah we make it right. Gonna miss the way you held me in the morning. I'm gonna miss the future we planned. The way we fought the way we kissed. The heat inside the tenderness. Love was our religion. This is our break up song but. Can't we just get along for the night. Not fight one less goodbye. But just a moment let me hold back. Baby hold back all the things we haven't said. Make love like we just met. Gonna miss the way you held me in the morning. I'm gonna miss the future that we planned. The way we fought the way we kissed. The heat inside the tenderness. Love was our religion. This is our break up song but. Can't we just get along for the night. In spite of the hurt we hide. For old times sake. Won't you just take me by the waist. Hold me underneath the sheets. Make love like our first week. This is our break up song but. Can't we just get along for the night. Not fight one less goodbye. But just a moment let me hold back. Baby hold back all the things we haven't said. Make love like we just met. Like we just met
1179,There is fiction in the space between. The lines on your page of memories. Write it down but it doesn't mean. You're not just telling stories. There is fiction in the space between. You and reality. You will do and say anything. To make your everyday life seem less mundane. There is fiction in the space between. You and me. There's a science fiction in the space between. You and me. A fabrication of a grand scheme. Where I am the scary monster. I eat the city and as I leave the scene. In my spaceship I am laughing. In your remembrance of your bad dream. There's no one but you standing. Leave the pity and the blame. For the ones who do not speak. You write the words to get respect and compassion. And for posterity. You write the words and make believe. There is truth in the space between. There is fiction in the space between. You and everybody. Give us all what we need. Give us one more sad sordid story. But in the fiction of the space between. Sometimes a lie is the best thing. Sometimes a lie is the best thing

Caught up in the sparkle in your eyes.. So wrong and I know I should go so. But it's not like me to wait.. Cause I'm alive and I'm on fire.. Shout loud like the starburst into the sky.. Oh the fury of desire you burn so bright. You electrify.. You line me up; you take me higher.. I've been down a long. And I've become a stranger to myself.. Digging in my heels and hoping time might be kinder. If I waited out.. Nothing came from wanting. And I became so small and insecure.. Didn't know the cost of all our lies. 'Til I found it fresh and new again with you.. And I'm on fire.. Shout loud like the starburst into the sky. Oh the fury of desire you burn so bright. You electrify. You line me up; you take me higher.. Loving you is easy. Loving you is wondrous and pure. I shouted from the rooftops. 'How long must I wait 'til I see you smile?'

I'm going there. No more to roam. I'm only going over Jordan. I'm only going over home. I know the dark clouds will gather around me. I know my way is rough and steep. That beauteous fields lie just before me. Where God's redeemed their vigils keep. I'm going there to see my mother. She said she need me when I come. I'm only going over Jordan. I'm only going over home. I am a poor wayfaring stranger. While travelling through this world of woe. There's no sickness toil or danger. In that blank world to which I go. I'm going there. To see my father. I'm going there. No more to roam. I'm only going over Jordan. I'm only going over home

1203,Carolina. Her tears are falling like the spanish moss. Disappearing. Into beauty found in beauty lost. So it goes. The summer blooms and fades away. Like moonlight falling on a bed. And there can be no solice in remembering. The words we never said. Faded postcards. Of all the places she loves best. Take her far away. As she presses wrinkles from her cotton dress. So it goes. The summer blooms and fades away. Like moonlight falling on a bed. And there can be no solice in remembering. The words we never said. So it goes. The summer blooms and fades away. Like moonlight crashing to the earth. And there can be no solice in remembering. The way things never were.
1204,I'm looking for a girl who has no face. She has no name or number. And so I search within his lonely place. Knowing that I won't find her. Well I can't stop this feeling deep in inside me. Ruling my mind. I feel no sound. Don't know where I'm bound. The scenery is all the same to me. Nothing has changed or faded. I'm a part of it some part of me. Painted cool green and shaded. So try to find myself must be the only way. To feel free
1206,DéŸ† gris sin ilusié«‡. (Grey day without hope.). Dé«‡de va mi corazé«‡.. (That's where my heart goes.). Necesito descansar.. (I need to rest.). Este no es un déŸ† mé†©.

1207,Better stop dreaming of the quiet life. 'Cos it's the one we'll never know. And quit running for that runaway bus. 'Cos those rosey days are few. And stop apologising for the things you've never done. 'Cos time is short and life is cruel. Well it's up to us to change. This town called malice uh uh yeah. Rows and rows of disused milk floats. stand dying in the dairy yard. And a hundred lonely housewives clutch empty milk. bottles to their hearts. Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry. It's enough to make you stop believing when tears come. fast and furious. In a town called malice uh uh yeah. Struggle after struggle. Year after year. The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice. I'm almost stone cold dead. In a town called malice uh uh yeah. A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef. gets dashed against the Co-op. To either cut down on beer or the kids new gear. It's a big decision in a town called malice uh uh yeah. The ghost of a steam train. Echoes down my track. It's at the moment bound for nowhere. Just going round and round. Playground kids and creaking swings. Lost laughter in the breeze. I could go on for hours and I probably will. But I'd sooner put some joy back. In this town called malice yeah yeah

1217,The lights change on the hill. The air seems strangely still. Everyone's asleep. The floorboards creak at dawn. As you walk out on the lawn. The grass is wet beneath. You think it rather strange. You think it rather weird. It's fair to say that. Nothing is keeping you here. Nothing is keeping you here. Nothing is keeping you here. The phone is off the hook. As you sink into a book. You don't know where you are. From the world detached. Onto a girl you latched. It never got too far. And everybody's down. And everybody cares. It's fair to say that. Nothing is keeping you here. Nothing is keeping you here. Nothing is keeping you here. And everybody talks. And everybody stares. You knew your day to shine. Would come without you here. Come without you here. Nothing was keeping you here. Here.... Nothing is keeping you here
1218,I don't know when we fell apart. The love that we had was like a work of art. I used to see heaven in your eyes. Now angels are falling from your skies. The things we said were so wrong. And I haven?t held you for so long. My foolish pride turns me inside. Why did we tell all those lies. If you can reach for the phone. You don?t have to be alone. Outside the wind it seems so cold. Your heart is frozen like the snow (snow). And there?s no one home to keep you safe and warm. Your eyes are red because you?ve cried (cried). You fell asleep by the fireside (fireside). but there?s one thing you should know. On this Christmas baby you don?t have to be alone. And I had only one wish on my list. For me you would be the perfect gift. There?s nothing colder than an empty home. (empty home). And holidays were never meant to be alone. (to be alone). The smiles we gave when our hearts were saved. By each others? love and warmth. That's subsided now no happiness around. If I can only find a way to your heart. Outside the wind it seems so cold. Your heart is frozen like the snow. And there?s no one home to keep you safe and warm. Your eyes are red because you?ve cried. You fell asleep by the fireside. but there?s one thing you should know. on this Christmas baby you don?t have to be alone. (Bridge:). You don?t have to be alone. You don?t have to be all alone (at Christmas). You don?t have to be alone. You don?t have to be all alone. Outside the wind it seems so cold. Your heart is frozen like the snow. And there?s no one home to keep you safe and warm. Your eyes are red because you?ve cried. You fell asleep by the fireside. but there?s one thing you should know. on this Christmas baby you don?t have to be alone
1219,You're the one who's always choking trojan. You're the one who's always bruied and broken. Sleep may be the enemy. But so's another line. It's a remedy. You should take more time. You're the one who's always choking trojan. You're the one whose shower's always golden. Spunk and bestiality. Well it's a sissy lie. It's ahead of me. You should close your fly. I understand the fascination. The dream that comes alive at night. But if you don't change your situation. Then you'll die. You'll die. Don't die. Don't die. Please don't die. You're the one who's always choking trojan. You're the one who's always bruied and broken. Drunk on immorality. Valium and cherry wine. Coke and ecstasy. You're gonna blow your mind. I understand the fascination. I've even been there once or twice or more. But if you don't change your situation. Then you'll die. You'll die. Don't die. Don't die. Please don't die. Please don't die. Please don't die. Please don't die

1221,After a year like this one. I'm surprised I did not hate your guts. And after a year like this one. I'm surprised I still love music just as much. After a year like this one. I'm suprised I did not eat my arm. After a year like this one. I'm sorry if I'm not cordial to everyone. After a year like this one. I'm surprised I am convinced at all. And after a year like this one. I do not roll my eyes at the cynical. After a year like this one. I can't help but wonder how they've been. And after a year like this one. I think I'll leave it all to my next of kin. After a year like this one. I'm suprised we're all not weeping drunks. And after a year like this one. I want you to choose the restaurant. And after a year like this one. I'll need a good whole sixteen months alone. After a year like this one. I think I'll make the west coast beaches my new home.

1228,Children born and raise on a Sunday. Hearing what their leaders say. Singing along. A story missing to the ones who wont listen. All the words are left alone. but I've been running out fighting to stay above the line. and I can feel the devil is close. It's gonna follow me down. It's gonna follow me down (let it follow). Last rites in a lost city. I can't fight for a life I've never known. Dark lights giving no pity. Last rites for the place I call my home. Fear is in the war for society. Hungry for the heresy. Never atone. A spark that glistens for the. Souls of a mission. Canonize this pile of stones. But I'm rebelling now. fighting to save my only life. I can feel the rapture is close. It's gonna follow me down. It's gonna follow me down (let it follow). Last rites in a lost city. I can't fight for a life I've never known. Dark lights giving no pity.

1232,Sometimes we walk hand in hand by the sea. And we breathe in the cool salty air. You turn to me with a kiss in your eyes. And my heart feels a thrill beyond compare. Then your lips cling to mine. It's wonderful wonderful. Oh so wonderful my love. Sometimes we stand on the top of a hill. And we gaze at the earth and stars. I turn to you and melt in your arms. There we are darling only you and I. What a moment to share. It's wonderful wonderful. Oh so wonderful my love. The world is filled with wond'rous things it's true. But they wouldn't have much meaning without you. Some quiet evening I sit by your side. And we're lost in a world of our own. I feel the glow of your unspoken love. I'm aware of the treasure that I own. And I say to myself. It's wonderful wonderful. Oh so wonderful my love. And I say to myself. It's wonderful wonderful. Oh so wonderful my love

Come on Joe time to go.. In out out in. Do it if you love me Joe"". I know it's art for art's sake but how much more can I take?. What's my share of this backlash love affair?. Her hair extension's down to her knees what a tease. She got tattoos everywhere you look she's a comic book. Why she goes for my type I'll never understand. She's so demure when we promenade hand in hand. And when we get back home she let's me know that she's in command. She said ""Left right right left. Come on Joe don't be slow.. Up down down up. Come on Joe it's time to go.. In out out in. Do it if you love me Joe"". I know it's art for art's sake but how much more can I take?. What's my share of this backlash love affair?.

Come on Joe don't be slow.. Up down down up. Come on Joe it's time to go.. In out out in. Do it if you love me Joe"". I know it's art for art's sake but how much more can I take?.

1285,Another day given. Another day I'm living. Another day where I can't figure what I am missing. The ball is in my court. I'm pacing back and fourth. I thought I loved the game and simply did it for the sport. I think about the money I think about the fame. When your broke as I am then you wouldn't blame. My angers building up. And keeps on filling up. Until it overflows and shows and I can't seal it up. Drink another beer until the pictures clear. Driving on this road to fame don't know what way to steer. People try to tell me I never wanna hear. Most of them are snakes hissing in my ear. They think I'm so dumb just cus im so young. But it shouldn't make a difference what year I come from. I' know I'm still a teen and yeah I'm still a kid. I feel like something missing I just don't know know what it is.. Empty (empty) spaces (spaces) fill me up with holes. Distant (distant) faces with no place left to go. Without you (without you) within me (within me). I can't find a way. Where I'm (where I'm) going (going). Is anybodies guess.. Another day passed. It ended so fast. Another day wasted that I can't get back. Why am I wasting time. Spitting all these rhymes. I think about it everytime I jot every single line. I've been through so much shit I've been through hell. But you could never tell cus I learned to hide it well. This is the life I live that's just the way it is. So many things ive done that I wish I never did. Im tryna be the best but that just causes stress. I should just drop the pen and not finish the test. I know it isn't right I know it so wrong. But what can I do when its been like this for so long. Don't try to understand because you never will. Erase all of the fake and this is how I really feel. You think this is a lie well look me in the eyes. And you can see just how incomplete I feel inside. Take a look at me and see through all the pride. You'll find all the pain and all the fear inside. Even with all my fans I've never felt more alone. But don't you save me cause I just wanna be on my own. Echoes in my head. Looking back into the times when I could wake. From this nightmare. And now my eyes are locked shut and I can't find my way home. I know I've made my mistakes I'm only human we're all the same. Thing's I'll pay for for the rest of my life but who are you to blame?. I can't (can't) take (take) the weight of the world (world). On (on) on my shoulders. There's something missing from me. I must be incomplete.
1288,Music :Rudolf Schenker. Lyrics:Klaus Meine. Hey baby listen up. I'm not in love with you. You keep runnin' off at the mouth. And someone else can scratch my back. And I could care less about your legs. I just wanna see 'em walk all over me. I'm runnin' out of patience. And I ain't gonna say it twice. The world out there is down'n dirty honey. And I just hate to be nice. So don't think about movin' any closer baby. Just forget about it. You body may be a weapon on legs. But hey I'm not fallin' for that. Don't you get it I'm not impressed at all. I just wanna see you crawl all over me. I'm runnin' out of patience. And I ain't gonna say it twice. The world out there is down'n dirty honey. And I just hate to be nice. Don't you understand. Don't you understand. Tell me when your eyes say yes. How can your lips say no. A girl like you shouldn't be surprised. It's just I hate to be nice. I'm runnin' out of patience. And I ain't gonna say it twice. The world out there is down'n dirty honey

1296,Ah fed Vixo on ev'ry fear 'n' fret 'n' phobia. Til it nor ah could stand the strain no longer. Sucked a chicken bone tossed it in the corner. Raisin up like Lazaurs up up from its cot.

Sittin on the roof laugh at mahself. As they rope off the woods. Watchin' all the good-people.
1298,There's a room in a hotel in new york city. That shares our fate and deserves our pity. I don't want to remember it all. The promises are made if you just hold on. Hold on hold on hold on hold on. I just did enough of you to dull the pain. Just to keep it through the night till we're twins again. Till we strip down to our skeletons again. Till we're saints just swimming in our sins again. And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on. Up above our heads droning on and on and on. Keep making trouble till find what you love. I need a new partner in crime and your shotgun. There's a room in a hotel in new york city. That shares our fate and deserves our pity. I don't want to remember it all. The promises are made if you just hold on. Hold on hold on hold on hold on. A birth and a death on the same day. And honey I only appear so I can fade away. I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream. And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame. And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on. Up above our heads droning on and on and on. Hit it never quit it I have been through the wreck. But I can scream enough to show my face in the light of day. There's a room in a hotel in new york city. That shares our fate and deserves our pity. I don't want to remember it all. The promises are made if you just hold on. Hold on hold on hold on hold on. Hold on hold on hold on hold on. Hold on hold on hold on hold on
1299,Talk over the radio that way everyone can hear. Louder than the stereo don't worry your head my dear. I think it's hilarious the way you talk about yourself. But don't tell that story again.. You're good for one thing I can't help but calling you out. You're so lovely I can't behave myself. Look into the mirror I know you're good at that. Don't be so insecure as long as you shut your mouth. Take yourself so serious like you're talking for your health. But don't tell that story again.. You're good for one thing I can't help but calling you out. You're so lovely I can't behave myself. Be slow. Anybody home?. You're good for one thing I can't help but calling you out. And you're so lovely I can not help myself. You're good for one thing I can't help but calling you out. And you're so lovely I can't behave myself
1300,Can you keep yourself on for good. Seems like the whole world is losing. How do you stop yourself up. Even if seems like the whole world is crying. Aaaah Oooooh. Aaaah Oooooh. She got all I need. The air I breath. When it comes to my valium skies. She don't mind if I cry. How do you stop your love from crying. Even if you knew she was lying.

She don't mind if I cry. She don't mind if I cry. She don't mind if I cry. Aaaah Oooooh. Aaaah Oooooh. She got all I need. The air I breath. When it comes to my valium skies. She don't mind if I cry.

1308,Some days are dry some days are leaky. Some days come clean other days are sneaky.. Some days take less but most days take more. Some slip through your fingers and on to the floor.. Some days you're quick but most days you're speedy. Some days you use more force than is necessary.. Some days just drop in on us.. Some days are better than others.. Some days it all adds up. And what you've got is enough.. Some days are better than others.. Some days are slippy other days are sloppy;. Some days you can't stand the sight of a puppy.. Your skin is white but you think you're a brother.. Some days are better than others.. Some days you wake up with her complaining.. Some sunny days you wish it was raining.. Some days are sulky some days have a grin;. And some days have bouncers and won't let you in.. Some days you hear a voice. Taking you to another place.. Some days are better than others.. Some days are honest some days are not;. Some days you're thankful for what you've got.. Some days you wake up in the army. And some days it's the enemy.. Some days are work most days you're lazy;. Some days you feel like a bit of a baby. Lookin' for Jesus and his mother.. Some days are better than others.. Some days you feel ahead;. You're making sense of what she said.. Some days are better than others.. Some days I hear a voice taking me to another place.. Some days are better then others.. .

And now my heart. Lies empty and still again. If he were here. I'd long to hold him near. But now it's clear. The price of love is dear. There goes my babe. There goes what might have been. There goes my babe. In the cool morning rain. And now my heart.

1320,"(chorus). I wonder if I care as much. As I did before. Last night I cried myself to sleep. For the one that makes me weep. I dried my eyes to greet the day. And wondered why I have to pay. The tears that I have shed by day. Give relief and wash away. The mem'ry of the life before. I wonder if I'll suffer more. (chorus). I wonder if I care as much. As I did before. My pride is made to say forgive. And take the blame for what you did. It's your mistake I'm thinkin' of. I wonder if I'm still in love. My heart can't thrive on misery. My life it has no destiny. When things get more. Than I can bear. I ask myself ""do I still care? "". (chorus). I wonder if I care as much. As I did before"

1324,You didn't see my valentine. I sent it via pantomime. While you were watching someone else. I stared at you and cut myself. It's all I do cause I'm not free. A fugitive too dull to flee. I'm amorous but out of reach. A still-life drawing of peach.. I'm a tulip in a cup. I stand no chance of growing up. I've made my peace I'm dead I”m done. I watch you live to have my fun.. I root for you I love you you -you-you-you. I made it to a dinner date. My teardrops seasoned every plate. I tried to dance but lost my nerve. I cramped up in my learning curve. I'm a tulip in a cup. I stand no chance of growing up. But I've resolved to sail on through. In the wake of tales of you…. I root for you I love you you -you-you-you
1325,I'm reaching out without a sound. My pride falls to the floor again. Inside my mind I search to find. A place just to call my own. Deep inside your eyes. I am blinded by your love. Still I run so far just to find that. I'm alone again. In my head. I hear you calling me. And I can't run ‘cause there's nothing left for me. When I fall you always follow me deep inside. Deep inside. Deep inside of my head. I just can't last as these feelings pass. Once again I hide the pain inside. The smile wears thin and the lies begin. To bring me down again. When I run I run so far away from you. I hide the pain and all the lies deep inside again. And all my faith I put in you. This time you take it all away. Inside my head. Deep inside. My head
1331,I’ve been trying to ease my mind. From this life that I have been thrown into. I no longer know who to trust. They keep hurting me no matter what I do. It’s a big world out there.

At the Sado County Auto Show...At the Sado County Auto Show. Can't be late ya gotta go! To the Sado County Auto Show. By your diamond headlights I can see. The tension almost seems.

The grace of God the face of love. In silence I feared my heart. Would remain words unheard. Inside a seperate mess of skin. But now I know that the skin just veils the soul. For I have seen the face of love. The grace of God the face of love. So take my hand and knowing. With it I also give my heart. Wanting to never be seperate again. Let eternity begin. If you were flame. I'd allow myself to be consumed completely. Were you wind I'd wish you to pass through me. But now I know that the skin just veils the soul. For I have seen the face of love. The grace of God the face of love.

Not afraid to fall to fall to fall anymore. Not afraid to fall.. (Verse 2). Well you won?t know what it?s like to be one in a million. Cause you?re constantly bothering yourself about your current position.. So stand up tall stop all your crying. Or you?ll never know what it is like to breathe in deep.

You were the one the one who would love me after the ball.. Well I arrived looked around but the room was full of strangers. Nowhere was a freindly face to be found.. Later on I awoke but the party it was over. There you were waiting to bring me 'round.. How many million miles day-oh?. How many million miles day-oh?. When I get up up up in the morning whoa! Lord I know.. When I look up up up in the morning whoa! Lord I know.. How many million miles day-oh?. How many million miles day-oh?.

1388,(yeah). I just came from the school. Another day that everyone used me like a tool. Why am I always the one being called fool. That ain't cool. But things keep repeating. Once and once again. All what I want is love. But all what I get is pain. Mother said me to never forget to smile. But she ain't being here for a while. Things changed. And people became more strange. I'm trying to keep me calm. But all what I see is rage. At every new time they hurt me. Another time that I'll feel like an hostage. It's being hard to keep crawling to the stage. Is it all about my pretty dam faith?. I'm there for them. But when I need them the most they always say. ''sorry I'm late''. And my answer: don't worry mate. You just forgot about my own case... again. And again. I need you close. Just hold me here and don't let go. I need you so close. I need you close. Just hold me here and don't let go. I need you so close. Dear mind I made it throught the day. I may have said ''I'm fine thanks''. To everyone gettin' on my way. But I swear I didn't mean it once. But it was enough to make it pass throught their scanner. Cause people are always asking ''how you going''. But they don't actually wait for an answer''. Maybe you're even dying or lying that doesn't matter. You have a lot to say? send them a letter. Or just write it down in your diary. Until it feels a bit better!. Yeah believe me it will. The rage goes away but the pain stills. On my heart in my mind. It's running all my body. She's gettin'hard to find. I'm feeling like I'm giving up. Or I'm just losing another fight. No please hold it tight!. But my nightmares became all real. I'm supposed to feel stuffs. That I can no longer feel. People are screaming around. And I'm just trying to be taken with the crowd. Cause they hate me and that breaks me. They tear me down and that takes me. I'm just trying to be good but they hate me!. They never wanted me to stay. Everytime I tried to get closer they just pulled me away. So now I'm darker and colder. That's what they say. 'cause really deep inside I'm feeling. I'm still beeding. You can't hear me but I'm screaming!. I'm stuck and I'm never getting free. I wish I could have faith but they've murdered me. I need you close. Just hold me here and don't let go. (yeah let's do it). (yeah just let it go... nah). I need you so close. I need you close. Just hold me here and don't let go. I need you so close. So that's my life. I think I'm lost on time. Right now. And forever

1393,Sometimes I feel like I can't even sing (say say the light). I'm very scared for this world. I'm very scared for me. Eviscerate your memory. Here's a scene. You're in the back seat laying down. The windows wrap around. To sound of the travel and the engine. All you hear is time stand still in travel. and feel such peace and absolute. The stillness still that doesn't end. But slowly drifts into sleep. The stars are the greatest thing you've ever seen. And they're there for you. For you alone you are the everything. I think about this world a lot and I cry. And I've seen the films and the eyes. But I'm in this kitchen. Everything is beautiful. And she is so beautiful. She is so young and old. I look at her and I see the beauty. Of the light of music. The voices talking somewhere in the house. Late spring and you're drifting off to sleep. With your teeth in your mouth. You are here with me. You are here with me. You have been here and you are everything. (repeat 1st verse).

1399,Chapter One. All the stars are out tonight it feels as though I might. Make some sense out of this madness will it turn out right. Who's to say where the wind will blow. Time will tell us if we're out of answers when it stops. Climb back down to the beginning. Take it from the top. Who's to say where the wind will blow. What happens when all your dreams are lying on the ground. Do you pick up the pieces all around. and if the world should fall apart hold on to what you know. Take your chances turn around and go. All the leaves are turning and the sky fades to gray. Strange our life coincides with the seasons of today. Who's to say where the wind will blow. What happens when everything is lying on the ground. Do you pick up the pieces all around. and if the world should fall apart hold on to what you know. Take your chances turn around and go. Carry on you say. Make the best of today. All I see is struggling on the way. Maybe when the sun crashes through the gray. I can find the strength to make it through the day. Through the day. What happens when all your dreams are lying on the ground. Do you pick up the pieces all around. and if the world should fall apart hold on to what you know. Take your chances turn around and go. Take your chances turn around and go

Who's gonna ride your wild horses?. Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee?. Ah the deeper I spin. Ah the hunter will sin for your ivory skin.. Took a drive in the dirty rain. To a place where the wind calls your name. Under the trees the river laughing at you and me.. Hallelujah! Heaven's white rose. The doors you open I just can't close.. Don't turn around don't turn around again.. Don't turn around your gypsy heart.. Don't turn around don't turn around again.. Don't turn around and don't look back.. Come on now love don't you look back.. Who's gonna ride your wild horses?. Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?. Who's gonna taste your saltwater kisses?. Who's gonna take the place of me?. Who's gonna ride your wild horses?. Who's gonna tame the heart of thee?
1402,I am glad to know about you. I am glad to know that this is true. When I look into your eyes. When I kiss your lips I cry. You are the epitome of beauty. You are the epitome of beauty. Nobody can replace you or deny you. I'm saying this 'cause I love you. You are the epitome of beauty. Beautiful to me. Oh oh. I am far beyond thankful. For everything you've done.

1405,Turn it up it's my song. I can't sing but I'll I'll sing along. Yeah I can feel it in my bones. A little rock a little roll. Take it fast take it slow. Let me tell you something. That you don't know. Well the bars are all closed. and we got no place to go. But we're all a little drunk and. We wanna hear some rock and roll. Is anybody listenin' no. Where did that old feeling go?. Don't stop listening to rock and roll. Another round to the sound that mojo music. Muddy waters said we got it. So we might as well us it. I asked Katie to dance and I almost blew it. I only kissed her on the mouth. Cuz she told me to do it. Is anybody listenin' no. Where did that old feeling go?. Don't stop listening to rock and roll. Is anybody listenin' no. Where did that old feeling go?. Don't stop listening to rock and roll. What does it take to be a liar. And all the chances we take. What we're measured by. I sat on my couch. And wondered why. It's such a beautiful day. I'm still sitting inside. All I know is I'm still waiting for my sun to shine.
1406,I caught the moon today. Pick it up. And throw it away all right. I got the perfect steal. A cleaner love. With a dirty feel all right. Fall out and take the bait. Eat the fruit. And kiss the snake goodnight. Common ruse dirty face. Pretty noose is pretty hate. And I don't like what you got me hanging from. Let your motor race. Pick it up. And get this mother gone. Out from and far away. The wooden stake. This thing has got me on. Diamond rope silver chain. Pretty noose is pretty pain. And I don't like what you got me hanging from. Common ruse dirty face. Pretty noose is pretty hate. And I don't care what you got. I don't care what you need. I don't want anything. And I don't like what you got me hanging from.
1408,Swing low sweet chariot. Coming for to carry me home. Swing low sweet chariot. Coming for to carry me home. I looked over Jordan. And what did I see. Coming for to carry me home. A band of angels. Coming after me. Coming for to carry me home. Swing low sweet chariot. Coming for to carry me home. Swing low sweet chariot. Coming for to carry me home. If you get there. Before I do. Coming for to carry me home. Tell all my friends. I'm coming too. Coming for to carry me home. Swing low sweet chariot. Coming for to carry me home. Swing low sweet chariot. Coming for to carry me home. Sometimes I'm up. And sometimes I'm down. Coming for to carry me home. But still my soul. Feels heavenly bound. Coming for to carry me home. Swing low sweet chariot. Coming for to carry me home. Swing low sweet chariot. Coming for to carry me home. Swing low sweet chariot. Coming for to carry me home. Swing low sweet chariot. Coming for to carry me home.
1410,You never asked me what I wanted. You only asked me why.. I never thought that so much trouble was restin' on my reply. I could say it was the nights when I was lonely. and you were the only one who'd come.. I could tell you that I like your sensitivity. when you know it's the way that you walk.. Why do you have to say that there's always someone. who can do it better than I can?. But don't you think that I know that walking on the water. won't make me a miracle man?. Baby's gotta have the things she wants.. You know she's gotta have the things she loves.. She's got a ten-inch bamboo cigarette holder. and her black patent leather gloves.. And I'm doing everything just tryin' to please her. even crawling around on all fours.. Oh I thought by now that it was gonna be easy. but she still seems to want for more.. (chorus). I hear they're givin' you a bad reputation. just because you've never been denied.. You try to say you've done it all before.. Baby you know that you just get tired.. Yet everybody loves you so much girl.. I just don't know how you stand the strain.. Oh I I'm the one who's here tonight. and I don't wanna do it all in vain.. (chorus).
1412,Took you like a shot. Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'. Let a couple years water down how I'm feelin' about you. And every time we talk. Every single word builds up to this moment. And I gotta convince myself I don't want it. Even though I do. You could break my heart in two. But when it heals it beats for you. I know it's forward but it's true. I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to. When I'm lyin' close to someone else. You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it. If I could do it all again I know I'd go back to you. Thinking reminiscing. My life's pretty lit but it's just you missing. Wishing I could be the light in your life. The way you still light my day through night. Thoughts of you in my mind. I'm searching and I hope one day I can find. But no one ever feels good. It's never just right. That's why. I know I'd go back to you. You could break my heart in two. But when it heals it beats for you. I know it's forward but it's true. I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to. When I'm lyin' close to someone else. You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it. If I could do it all again I know I'd go back to you. I should be babygirl livin'. I know we left messy but it all is forgiven. Ringing your line hoping it will go through. And maybe one more time we could talk this through (go back to you). Thoughts of you in my mind. I'm searching and I hope one day I can find. But no one ever feels good. It's never just right. That's why. I know I'd go back to you. You could break my heart in two. But when it heals it beats for you. I know it's forward but it's true. I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to. When I'm lyin' close to someone else. You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it. If I could do it all again I know I'd go back to you. I'd go back to you. I'd go back to you. I know I'd go back to you. I'd go back to you. I'd go back to you. I know I'd go back to you. I know I'd go back to you

1414,Will you remember the dress I wore? Will you remember my face?. Will you remember the lipstick I wore? This world is a wonderful place.. Will you remember the black limousine? Will you remember champagne?. Will you remember the things that we've seen? I will return here again.. Will you remember the flowers in my hand? Will you remember my hair?. Will you remember the future we planned? The world is not waiting out there.. I won't remember the dress I wore. I won't remember champagne.. I won't remember the things that we swore. I will just love you in vain.. Will you remember? Will you recall? Will you remember?

1419,Remember those good times we had. I thought you were my friend. What I felt to be a dream. Was just a nightmare in the end. I trusted you you trusted me. Nothing could go wrong. Until I finally figured out. You were evil all along. What I'd give to see you gone. I never felt this way before. I'd love to see that face you make. When I walk out the door. 'Cause God can't save you from all your sins. When you threw your life away you let the devil in. Now I can't save you I know you too well. Like everyone and everything you drag me. you drag me to hell. Drag me. Drag me. Drag me. Trapped inside these prison walls. With no way to escape. What I felt to be my life. Was just a big mistake. I thought of you I thought it through. Everything was clear. The only way from this cage. Was for you to disappear. What I'd give to see you gone. I'm sure you've heard this all before. I'd love to see that face you make. When I walk out the door. 'Cause God can't save you from all your sins. When you threw your life away you let the devil in. Now I can't save you I know you too well. Like everyone and everything you drag me. you drag me to hell. Drag me. Drag me. Drag me. You drag me to hell. Hope you had fun. Now that we're done. It's over this time. I'm on to your lies. Get into your head. Our love is dead. I don't think about you. No I don't think about you anymore. 'Cause God can't save you from all your sins. When you threw your life away you let the devil in. Now I can't save you I know you too well. Like everyone and everything you drag me you drag me to hell. Drag me. Drag me. Drag me. You drag me to hell. Drag me. Drag me. Drag me. You drag me to hell. Drag me. Drag me. Drag me. You drag me to hell
1420,"John and Mitchy were gettin' kind of itchy. Just to leave the folk music behind. Zal and Denny workin' for a penny. Tryin' to get a fish on the line. In a coffee house Sebastian sat. And after every number they'd pass the hat. McGuinn and McGuire just a-gettin' higher. In L.A. you know where that's at. And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass. Zally said ""Denny you know there aren't many"". ""Who can sing a song the way that you do let's go south"". Denny said ""Zally golly don't you think that I wish"". ""I could play guitar like you"". Zal Denny and Sebastian sat (at the Night Owl). And after every number they'd pass the hat. McGuinn and McGuire still a-gettin higher. In L.A. you know where that's at. And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass. When Cass was a sophomore planned to go to Swarthmore. But she changed her mind one day. Standin' on the turnpike thumb out to hitchhike. ""Take me to New York right away"". When Denny met Cass he gave her love bumps. Called John and Zal and that was the Mugwumps. McGuinn and McGuire couldn't get no higher. But that's what they were aimin' at. And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass. Mugwumps high jumps low slumps big bumps. Don't you work as hard as you play. Make up break up everything is shake up. Guess it had to be that way. Sebastian and Zal formed the Spoonful. Michelle John and Denny gettin' very tuneful. McGuinn and McGuire just a-catchin' fire. In L.A. you know where that's at. And everybody's gettin' fat except Mama Cass. Di-di-di-dit dit dit di-di-di-dit who-o-oa. ------ flute ------. Broke busted disgusted agents can't be trusted. And Mitchy wants to go to the sea. Cass can't make it she says we'll have to fake it. We knew she'd come eventually. Greasin' on American Express cards. It's low rent but keeping out the heat's hard. Duffy's good vibrations and our imaginations. Can't go on indefinitely. And California dreamin' is becomin' a reality"
1423,Feels like I'm miles from here in other towns. With lesser names where lonely ghost doesn't tell. Merry old William exactly what they want to hear. You remember the house that we drew. Told you and the devil to both just leave me alone. If this is salvation I can show you the trembling. You'll just have to trust me. I'm scared. I am the patron saint of lost causes. Aren't we all to you just near lost causes. Are we all to you just lost?. Tell me you're left behind. Something you'll mean everything right before you die. But if you gain the world. You've already lost four little souls from your life. Widows and orphans are hard to find. Their home is in daddy who's saving you random tonight. Where's your drink? And would hurry and kill you. Sympathy's better than having to tell you the truth. That you are the patron saint of lost causes. All you are to them is now a lost cause. All you are to them is now causes. Billy don't you understand?. Timothy stood as long as he could. You made his faith disappear. More like a magician. And less like a man of the cloth. We're not questioning God. Just those he chose to carry on his cause. We'll grow better you'll see. Just all of us the lost causes. Aren't we all to you just lost causes?. Aren't we all to you lost?. Lost causes. Aren't we all to you. Is all we are is all we are. What we are is all we are. Choir:. They just saved all of the lost like you. They just saved all of the lost like you. They just saved all of the lost like you. He just saved all of the lost like you. They just saved all of the lost like you. (Lost causes we are is all we are). They just saved all of the lost like you. (To you lost causes). They just saved all of the lost like you. They just saved all of the lost like you. They just saved all of the lost like you. He just saved
1425,Look at ya. Yeah take a look in the mirror now tell me what you see. Another satisfied customer in the front of the line for the American dream. I remember when we was both out on the boulevard. Talkin' revolution and singin' the blues. Nowadays it's letters to the editor and cheatin' on our taxes. Is the best that we can do. Come on. Look around. There's doctors down on Wall Street. Sharpenin' their scalpels and tryin' to cut a deal. Meanwhile back at the hospital. We got accountants playin' God and countin' out the pills. Yeah I know that sucks – that your HMO. Ain't doin' what you thought it would do. But everybody's gotta die sometime and we can't save everybody. It's the best that we can do. Four score and a hundred and fifty years ago. Our forefathers made us equal as long as we can pay. Yeah well maybe that wasn't exactly what they was thinkin'. Version six-point-oh of the American way. But hey we can just build a great wall around the country club. To keep the riff-raff out until the slump is through. Yeah I realize that ain't exactly democratic but it's either them or us and. And it's the best we can do. Yeah passionely conservative. It's the best we can do. Conservatively passionate. It's the best we can do. Meanwhile still thinkin'. Hey let's wage a war on drugs. It's the best we can do. Well I don't know about you but I kinda dig this global warming thing...

1431,(Not Too Loud). I'ma PYT with an attitude. Sometimes I rebound from what I'm supposed to do. But when your love conquered my heart. I knew I had to have you all of the time. See I've been gone for a while now. There's nothing I can take. The miles keep us away and I feel.... [Chorus]. Without you I'm running out of energy. I want you here with me. And baby without you. I'm stalling on this road alone. When I'm gone too long. I'm running on empty without you. I'm going without because I'm running on E. And yes I know this effect. Baby I'm running on empty without you. Choose the game I'm telling you. Boy in your eyes I saw the truth (saw the truth yeah). 1Cause It was just so right. And now that I got you.

And I never want to be too far away. [Chorus]. Without you I'm running out of energy. I want you here with me. And baby without you. I'm stalling on this road alone. When I'm gone too long. I'm running on empty without you. I'm going without because I'm running on E. And yes I know this effect. Baby I'm running on empty without you. Without you I'm running out of energy. I want you here with me. And baby without you. I'm stalling on this road alone. When I'm gone too long. I'm running on empty without you. I'm going without because I'm running on E. And yes I know this effect. Baby I'm running on empty without you
1433,Nice guys finish last. You're running out of gas. Your sympathy will get you left behind. Sometimes you're at your best. When you feel the worst. Do you feel washed up. Like piss going down the drain?. Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane. I'm so fucking happy I could cry. Every joke can have its truth and now the joke's on you. I never knew you were such a funny guy. Oh nice guys finish last. When you are the outcast. Don't pat yourself on the back. You might break your spine. Living on command.

1438,Written By Warren Zevon. published by Warner-Tamerlane/Darkroom Music BMI 1976. . I was sitting in the Hollywood Hawaiian Hotel. I was staring in my empty coffee cup. I was thinking that the gypsy wasn't lyin'. All the salty margaritas in Los Angeles. I'm gonna drink 'em up. And if California slides into the ocean. Like the mystics and statistics say it will. I predict this motel will be standing until I pay my bill. Don't the sun look angry through the trees. Don't the trees look like crucified thieves. Don't you feel like Desperados under the eaves. Heaven help the one who leaves. Still waking up in the mornings with shaking hands. And I'm trying to find a girl who understands me. But except in dreams you're never really free. Don't the sun look angry at me. I was sitting in the Hollywood Hawaiian Hotel. I was listening to the air conditioner hum. It went mmmmmm... ........................... Look away........................................... (Look away down Gower Avenue Look away....).
1439,sung by Jim. Step back and watch the sweet thing. breaking everything she sees. she can take my darkest feeling. tear it up till i'm on me knees. plug into her electric cool. where things bend and break. and shake to the rule. talking fast couldn't tell me something. i would shed my skin for you. talking fast on the edge of nothing. i would break my back for you. don't know why don't know why. things vaporise and rise to the sky. and we tried so hard. and we looked so good. and we lived our lives in black. but something about you felt like pain. you were my sunny day rain. you were the clouds in the sky. you were the darkest sky. but your lips spoke gold and honey. that's why i'm happy when it rains. i'm happy when it pours. looking at me enjoying something. that feels like feels like pain. to my brain. and if i tell you something. you take me back to nothing. i'm on the edge of something. you take me back. and i'm happy when it rains.
1440,The energy I see. The silence that you speak. The lust within my dreams. And what I t says to me. This full heart of mine. You just can't empty. So come lay with me. China love. How pleasant life will be. China love. As the sun retires. Our love will transpire. Make love to me. China love. I see the sunshine. When I look into your eyes. They speak of worlds gone by. We loved another time. My heart was empty. Till you came to be. So come lay with me. China love. How pleasant life will be. China love. As the sun retires. Our love will transpire. Make love to me.
1441,White house on the beach. My steps down to the sand. The plane takes off and we. We are jet when it lags. Waiting in a room. Where the windows won't open. Got coffee with no mud. And their heart still ain't broken. Still ain't broken. Still ain't broken. And the music stops. And the beat goes on. And the music stops. But I'm dancing on. I won't be home until I've walked. Every street in New York. And I'll walk on without your love. Without your love. Dancing on til I'm alone. There's no need to return. Without your love until I have walked. Every street in New York. Boat goes. From one island to the next. An old man drinking beer. Women on the bench. And the music stops. And the beat goes on. And the music stops. But I'm dancing on. I won't be home until I've walked. Every street in New York. And I'll walk on without your love. Without your love. Dancing on til I'm alone. There's no need to return. Without your love until I have walked. Every street in New York. Glory when my plane takes off. Don't know me when I'm home. Say your prayers with your fingers crossed. Forget to call fore I go. If I had to phone tonight. To say I made you sad. And though I've fallen in your call and palm. I won't be home until I've walked. Every street in New York. And I'll walk on without your love. Without your love. Dancing on til I'm alone. There's no need to return. Without your love until I have walked. Every street in New York
1443,These are the words. But not the truth. God bless them all. When they speak to you. But that's all right. On an empty stage. Sing out when. There's no other way. Come drift the town. Where secrets lie. Where friends & neighbors. Keep drifting by. But that's all right. You're here to stay. Sing out tonight. The empty page. I always thought I'd see. Your name in flashing light. You did it all for free girl. And freely ripped the night. (Your free to fight). These are the words. But not the truth. God bless them all. When they speak to you. But that's all right. You're here to stay. Sing out tonight. The empty page. Do you remember the time?. When you were new in town. You smashed your head in the mirror baby. And kissed the frozen ground. (Your ripped up sound)
1445,Well my daddy worked in the coal mine. ‘Till the company shut it down. Then he sat around and drank hisself blind. ‘Till we put him back underground. Now nothin’ grows on this mountain. And what’s a poor boy to do?. Except to wander these hills forgotten. With the oxycontin blues. Well I never cared much for whiskey. ‘Cause it only made daddy mean. Wrapped a little bit tight they tell me. For the methamphetamine. Then my cousin come up from Knoxville. And he taught me a thing or two. Now I’m headed nowhere but downhill. With the oxycontin blues. Got a dollar bill in my pocket. Got a half a tank in my truck. I’m gonna go and pawn grandma’s locket. Hell maybe it’ll change my luck. Ain’t nothin gonna be right no how. ‘Cause I know I can’t ever lose. This devil that’s draggin’ me down. And the oxycontin blues
1446,There is a house in new orleans. They call the rising sun. It's been the ruin of many a poor boy. And god i know i'm one. I cried to my daddy on the telephone. how long now.

At my side is God. And there ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. There's people around who tell you that they know.

And there ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. I've been built up and trusted.

1455,In this proud land we grew up strong. We were wanted all along. I was taught to fight. Taught to win. I never thought I could fail. No fight left or so it seems. I am a man whose dreams have all deserted. I've changed my face. I've changed my name. But no one wants you when you lose. Don't give up. 'Cause you have friends. Don't give up. You're not beaten yet. Don't give up. I know you can make it good. Though I saw it all around. Never thought that I could be affected. Thought that we'd be the last to go. It is so strange the way things turn. Drove the night toward my home. The place that I was born on the lakeside. As daylight broke I saw the earth. The trees had burned down to the ground. Don't give up. You still have us. Don't give up. We don't need much of anything. Don't give up. 'Cause somewhere there's a place where we belong. Rest your head. You worry too much. It's going to be alright. When times get rough. You can fall back on us. Don't give up. Please don't give up. Got to walk out of here. I can't take anymore. Going to stand on that bridge. Keep my eyes down below. Whatever may come. And whatever may go. That river's flowing. That river's flowing. Moved on to another town. Tried hard to settle down. For every job so many men. So many men no-one needs. Don't give up. 'Cause you have friends. Don't give up. You're not the only one. Don't give up. No reason to be ashamed. Don't give up. You still have us. Don't give up now. We're proud of who you are. Don't give up. You know it's never been easy. Don't give up. 'Cause I believe there's a place. There's a place where we belong
1458,Cat's droolin' on the bar stool. Shake your hips and crack your whips. Cheap seventeen and trashed out. You went too far been a bitch you are. Your reputation's in the bathroom. It's on the wall and down the hall. I hear you're cheatin' with my teacher after school. Tell me what you do. When you know. You always get the boys you like. Play nice. Then stick them with your knife. Take off your insecure disguise. Is that you. Crawlin' up my stairs. Is that you. (Is that you crawlin' up my stairs). Is that you. Lookin' half way dead. Write on the mirror with your lipstick. Much too vain got scattered brains. You used me just enough to get off. Act your age get off your stage. When you know. You always get the boys you like. Play nice. Then stick them with your knife. Take off your insecure disguise. Is that you. Crawlin' up my stairs. Is that you. (Is that you crawlin' up my stairs). Is that you. Lookin' half way dead.

1459,I've thought about it for a while. and I've thought about the many miles. but I think it's time that I've gone away. The fellings that you have for me. have gone away it's plain to see. and it looks to me. that you're pulling away. I'm gonna pick it up. I'm gonna pick it up today. I'm bound to pack it up. I'm bound to pack it up. and go away. I find it hard to say to you. that this is what I have to do. but there is no way that I'm gonna stay. there is so many things. you need to know. and I wanna tell you before I go. but it's hard to think of just what to say. I'm sorry to leave you all alone. you're sitting silent by the phone. but we've always known there would come a day. The bus is warm and softly lit. and a hundred people ride in it. I guess I'm just another running away.
1461,[Verse]. She still remembers a time that was uncomplicated. But sure as the sun rise. She's seen things that you'll never see. Losses and heartache amount to her strength. But oh how they both take their toll. [Refrain]. She's still here fighting. Better know there's life in her yet. [Chorus]. Time will take us all and turn us into stones. It leaves us with regrets. And picks apart the threads. Hung over fragile bones. [Hook]. Let her go. I can't let her go. I can't let her go. [Verse]. Her hands tell the story. Of hardships that we'll never know. Her face is a map of. A lifetime on well traveled roads. But those eyes tell nothing. Of a soul that is spared. A heart that is longing for death. [Refrain]. She's still here fighting. Better know there's life in her yet. [Chorus]. Time will take us all and turn us into stones. It leaves us with regrets. And picks apart the threads. Hung over fragile bones. [Hook]. Let her go.

1482,Daniel says “it’s over now for good”. I wish you could convince him that you should still be friends still be helping each other. Still be friends.. He says he knows you better than you know yourself put him in the queue or on the shelf. Don’t you think it’s time for you to make some progress. Don’t you think it’s time for a revolution?. Daniel says to you that we won’t work. That I’m too young that I’m a homo jerk. Isn’t that a bit ridiculous for a grown up? Isn’t that a bit ridiculous?. Lilly says “it’s over now for good”. I wish I could convince her that we should still be friends still be helping each other. Still be friends.
1483,You didn't care you went and broke my heart. I'll get ya back you know it's gonna start. You gave me pain that`s whatcha done to me. When I get through you'll be sorry you met me. You'll wish you were never born. Blackmail blackmail. I'll make you pay. For the life that you tore. Blackmail. Black. Mail. You put it to me and now we'll play my game.

1484,Time is the healer time was on my hands. The bus stopped at Tiffany's. So I went to hear the band. I saw Cinderella then the curtain dropped. Time hung heavy on my hands but today. The clock just stopped. I heard the music saw those pictures on the wall. I fell in love with Tiffany's I thought it said it all. Soothed by your saxophones I thought you'd understand. I'd love to sing my songs for you but I don't know if I can. Said don't know if I can don't know if I can. Midnight is striking there's a pumpkin by the door. It's five o'clock and the streets are clear am I alone once more ?. I watched the dawn in an electric storm my compass blew haywire. There she stands with a slipper in her hand. And her eyes were the colour of fire. I saw you crying from that doorway for sometime. It's no use drying your eyes 'cos I see those tell tale signs. I saw you crying from that doorway for sometime. It's no use drying your eyes 'cos I see those tell tale signs. I see those tell tale signs I see those tell tale signs. Time is no healer in truth she plays no part. When money's got you in your pocket where can she put your heart ?. She led a charmed life so I believe. Before she left she wrote a note and this is how it reads. I saw you crying from that doorway for sometime. It's no use drying your eyes 'cos I see those tell tale signs. I saw you crying from that doorway for sometime. It's no use drying your eyes 'cos I see those tell tale signs. I see those tell tale signs I see those tell tale signs.
1489,The moment I wake up. In my imaginary world. Standing on the roof top. I see the sorrow and the hurt. I look at all the people. Fighting battles down below. Everybody is a hero. But they just don't know. But I know. 'Cause every night when I'm asleep. I'm turning dragons into dreams. I can make the monsters fade. And I never feel afraid. I become a man of steel. Somehow I make it real. Like on the silver screen. I turn dragons into dreams. If I had the power. I would give it all to you. And that's what my wish is. To make you invincible too. For you to see what I see. Every time I close my eyes. I know that you're amazing. Wouldn't that be nice?. So nice. 'Cause every night when I'm asleep. I'm turning dragons into dreams. I can make the monsters fade. And I never feel afraid. I become a man of steel. Somehow I make it real. Like on the silver screen. I turn dragons into dreams. Daylight comes and I don't know. How I manage to find you. Say I will. 'Cause every night when I'm asleep. I'm turning dragons into dreams. I can make the monsters fade. And I never feel afraid. I become a man of steel. Somehow I make it real. Like on the silver screen. I turn dragons into dreams
1490,"Outside America. Everybody's just waking up. Drinking coffee from a paper cup. To the sound of the radio. And there's a broke town girl. In the parking lot. Shaking off her dress with everything she's got. Last night she started dancing and she couldn't stop. Daylight came and it broke her heart. She's been up all night. Dream so big. In a town where dreams don't bit. Come on now people it's all we got. We feel it in our hearts for sure. Like a song that's been playing for all our lives. We know it's right. We heard it on the radio. Outside America. There's a boy and there's a girl he loves. But he never really gave enough. So she couldn't take no more. She said she couldn't stay oh-oh. She had to walk away. Cause she's never gonna get it. Never gonna get it. And she's never gonna live that way. He says ""Oh my God I feel like hell"". Come on now people it's all we got. We feel it in our hearts for sure. Like a song that's been playing for all our lives. We know it's right. We heard it on the radio. And its all these moments that. Start all the fires that. Make all these moments burn bright. So how can all this be right. Come on now people it's all we got. I feel it in my hearts for sure. Like a song that's been playing for all our lives. We know it's right. We heard it on the radio. Oh-oh. We know it's right. Cause we heard it on the radio. We know it's right. We heard it on the radio"
1491,One more body left all alone. She's made another heart her home. Lost between the sea and the sky. An angel learning how to fly. She floats above our bodies asleep in their graves. Dancing in the moonlight glow. (I can't have her save me from her). Our memories hide in vain hoping they can be saved. But she leaves the ones that won't let her go. I always hear her voice when she calls. Guided by her tears as they fall. She loves everything and nothing at all. Why does this girl live in my dream. More happy than she's ever seemed. (I can't have her save me from her). Lost between her moon and her sun. What am I supposed to love. (I can't have her save me from her). She floats above our bodies left cold in their graves. Wrapped beneath the moonlight glow. (I can't have her save me from her). Our memories die in vain knowing they won't be saved. She forgot the ones of us long ago. I've pulled apart my heart. I've taken all the love out. (I can't save me from her). I've pulled apart my heart. I've taken all the love out. I've taken all the love out
1494,Let's talk it over let's get get it straight. Don't let th' situation escalate. You know there's always problems when a man is wrapped up in his art. But don't you worry baby you can count on me to do my part. You keep on working I'm looking round. Don't let your girlfriend put me down. You know it's tough these days for a proud man to make a start. But don't you worry baby you can count on me to do my part. You wash the dishes I've gotta run. You know that night life ain't such fun. Now don't wait up for me 'cause I know you need your rest sweetheart. But don't you worry baby you can count on me to do my part.

1497,"When I turned on the lights. I saw you walk to me. I felt my eyes burn. When I looked at your damp skin. Your laughter is so true. Full of love to give. I hold you in my arms. I'll never let you leave. Sing in your heart. And take you beyond the skies. I want to be everything. That does the reason you smile. Walking on this black floor. I remember when I found you. You told me that I filled your heart empty. When I said ""I love you"". You got so shy. Not knowing what to do. Come on let's go to the bed. Let's drink and listen to blues. Sing in your heart. And take you beyond the skies. I want to be everything. That does the reason you smile"
1499,by Warren Zevon. Lord Byron had a lot of luggage. He took it when he traveled far and wide. He didn't get to bathe very often. But he liked to change his clothes all the time. I had a little friend named Mister Johnson. Who always tried to be like me. He rose to the heights of this profession. He was hard on his friends and family. Still out here in the wind and rain. Look a little older but I feel no pain. And it stands to reason. I'm still looking for love. I went to the Henley Regatta. Intending to put out to sea. They pronounced me persona non grata. Goes to show that you can't come and go. as you please. Still out here in the wind and rain. Look a little older but I feel no pain. And it stands to reason. I'm still looking for love. Looking for a needle in a haystack. It's pretty hard to find. Every dog has his day Jack. I'm still waiting for mine.. Still out here in the wind and rain. A whole lot older but I feel no pain. And it stands to reason. I'm still looking for love.
1500,Every day I see him coming / Every day he walks on by / Life used to be so plain and simple / Before he came into my life / Every night I keep on dreaming / Every night I take him home / We always go to bed together / I always wake up all alone / Oh it's strange so strange / What he's doing to me / Oh it's strange so strange / Did this ever happen to you / The way it has happened to me / The way it just happened to me / Every day outside my window / Always minutes close to eight / I wish he stayed a little longer / But his bus is never late / Every night we're dancing slowly / I play the music he adores / Like Sinatra then we're talking / All important things for sure / Oh it's strange so strange / What he's doing to me / Oh it's strange so strange / Did this ever happen to you / The way it has happened to me / The way it just happened to me / Oh it's strange so strange / What he's doing to me / Oh so strange real strange / Did this ever happen to you / The way it has happened to me / The way it just happened to me.
1501,It was one of those nights when you turn out the lights. And everything comes into view. She was taking her time I was loosing my mind. There was nothing that she wouldn't do. It wasn't the first wasn't the last. She knew we were making love. I was so satisfied deep down inside. Like a hand in a velvet glove. Seems like a touch a touch too much. Seems like a touch a touch too much. Too much for my body too much for my brain. This damn woman's gonna drive me insane. She has a touch a touch too much. She had the face of an angel smiling with sin. The body of venus with arms. Dealin' with danger strokin' my skin. Like a thunder and lightening storm. It wasn't the first wasn't the last. It wasn't that she didn't care. She wanted it hard wanted it fast. She liked it done medium rare. Seems like a touch a touch too much. Seems like a touch a touch too much. Too much for my body too much for my brain. This damn woman's gonna drive me insane. She has a touch a touch too much. Touch me!. Seems like a touch (touch too much). You know it's much too much (much too much). I really wanna feel ya (touch too much). Girl you know you're givin' me (much too much). Seems like a touch (touch too much). Just a dirty little touch (much too much). I really need your touch (touch too much). 'Cause you're much too much too much too much. Seems like a touch. A touch too muchX2. Give me you touch. A touch too much. Baby you've got a touch. A touch too much. Seems like a touch. A touch too muchX4. Touch!. Come on and touch me!. Yeah! ah!.
1502,I've been pushing all my life all my life all my life I've been pushing all my life. I've been pushing all my life all my life all my life I've been pushing all my life. For some want to see right through all the false alarms I pulled. Some want to stand their ground when I start to tear them down. Someone to to outlast the hold ups that hold me back. For someone to make it past the guards of a cynical heart. Sick of singing now. Oh I always jump ship. And we are closer than I've ever been. I say we stand in the fire and hope we can burn our way out. The road to my heart gets hot as hell. I've been pushing all my life all my life all my life I've been pushing all my life. I've been pushing all my life all my life all my life I've been pushing all my life. For some want to call me out when I start to run my mouth. Some want to talk down from ledges that I have found. Someone to hold me close when I'm screaming to let go. Someone to make it past the guards of a cynical heart. Sick of singing now. Oh I always jump ship. And we are closer than I've ever been. I say we stand in the fire and hope we can burn our way out. The road to my heart gets hot as hell. I've been pushing all my life all my life all my life I've been pushing all my life. I've been pushing all my life all my life all my life I've been pushing all my life. I know that its not fair to think that you'd still be there. But if you leave with a pattern of beats. I'm pushing you away but its not what I mean. Oh I'm ashamed and cannot believe that this is what takes just to get close to me. Is this what it takes just to get close to me. Is this what it takes just to get close to me. Oh I always jump ship. And we are closer than I've ever been. Oh I always jump ship. And we are closer than I've ever been. I say we stand in the fire and hope we can burn our way out. The road to my heart gets hot as hell. I've been pushing all my life all my life all my life I've been pushing all my life.

1503,They try to kill the president. They try to put a shiny bullet in his head. He leave a resident. He couldn't pay the bill and wound up dead. I am not above this. Who put these thoughts in my head in my head?. I could grow to love this. Who put this gun in my hand in my hand?. They want to know where the money went. They'll break a bone for every dime you spent. They'll cut your throat for the hell of it. They're going to cover you in wet cement. I am not above this. Who put these thoughts in my head in my head?. I could grow to love this. Who put this gun in my hand in my hand?. With lives in his hands. I see why he loves this. He thinks he's a God.

I could grow to love this. Who put this gun in my hand in my hand?
1504,"Whoa-oh-oh-oh. (1234). I feel a hunger. It's a hunger that tries to keep a man awake at night. Are you the answer?. I shouldn't wonder when I can feel you with my appetite.

1508,I drive around this town. In a Mustang with the top down. And six running horses under my hood. Well that's good enough for me. Don't need the real thing. That's just another thing. For me to try to tame. Don't know if I could. It might just break me. I thought there for a little while. Every sunset I'd be a riding off with him. Snap buttons on a denim shirt. Blue jeans and a little dirt. That's the closest you'll see me. Feet hanging out a pickup truck. Crazy and a little rough. Running free. That's the closest to a cowboy. You'll see me. Before I met him. I was so sane and grounded. Before he taught me how to lie. And crawl out the window. I learned the dirt roads. And I got my heart broken. Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry. And how to let go. I thought there for a little while. Every sunset I'd be a riding off with him. Snap buttons on a denim shirt. Blue jeans and a little dirt. That's the closest you'll see me. Feet hanging out a pickup truck. Crazy and a little rough. Running free. That's the closest to a cowboy. You'll see me. It was all a little. Wonderful and strange. But I'll never look. At a sunset the same night. Snap buttons on a denim shirt. Blue jeans and a little dirt. That's the closest you'll see me. Feet hanging out a pickup truck. Crazy and a little rough. Running free. Sitting fishing by the river bank. Swimming in the water tank. That's the closest you'll see me. Feet hanging out a pickup truck. Crazy and a little rough. Running free. That's the closest to a cowboy. You'll see me
1513,Halo.... Remember those walls I built. Well baby they're tumbling down. And they didn't even put up a fight. They didn't even make a sound. I found a way to let you in.

1519,Once upon a time there was a girl. In her early years she had to learn. How to grow up living in a war that she called home. Never knew just where to turn for shelter from the storm. It hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face. Every time my father's fist would put her in her place. Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room. Hoping it would be over soon. Chorus:. Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same. And I still remember how you kept me so afraid. Stenght is my mother for all the love she gave. And every morning that I wake I look back at yesterday. And I'm Ok. I often wonder why I carry all this guilt. When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built. Shadows stir at night trough a crack in the door. Echoes of broken child screaming please no more. Daddy don't you understand the damage you have done. For you is just a memory but for me it still lives on. Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same. And I still remember how you kept me so so afraid. Stenght is my mother for all the love she gave. And every morning that I pray I look back to yesterday. It's not so easy to forget all the marks you left along her neck. When I was thrown against cold stairs. And everyday afraid to come home in fear of what I might see next. Chorus. Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same. And I still remember how you kept me so afraid. Stenght is my mother for all the love she gave. And every morning that I wake I look back at yesterday. And I'm Ok

1531,"Sun Green started makin' waves. On the day that Grandpa died. Speakin' out against anything. Unjust or packed with lies. She chained herself to a statue of an eagle. In the lobby of Power Co.. And started yelling through a megaphone. ""There's corruption on the highest floor."". Suits poured out of elevators. ""You're all dirty."". Phoneheads began to speak. ""You can't trust any of them."". Security couldn't get her down. She was welded to the eagle's beak.. Sun Green leaned into that megaphone said. ""Truth is all I seek."". Security brought in some blow torches. News cameras recorded her speech. ""When the city is plunged into darkness. by an unpredicted rolling blackout. The White House always blames the governor. Saying the solution is to vote him out."". On top of that great bronze eagle. Sun's voice was loud and clear. She said. ""Power Co's working with the White House. to paralyze our state with fear."". It was a golden moment. In the history of TV news. No one could believe it. It just got great reviews. ""Hey Mr. Clean you're dirty now too.. Hey Mr. Clean you're dirty now too.. Hey Mr. Clean you're dirty now too.. Hey Mr. Clean you're dirty now too."". The Imitators were playing. Down at Jon Lee's bar. When Sun went down to see â€˜em. Someone followed her in a car. Now when she goes dancin'. She has to watch her back. The FBI just trashed her room. One of them kicked her cat. Damn thing scratched his leg. So he had to shoot it dead. And leave it lyin' in a puddle of blood. At the foot of Sun Green's bed. Jon Lee's was rockin'. The Imitators drove it home. Sun was dancin' up a heat wave. For awhile she was all alone. When up walked a tall stranger. Shadowed her move to move. In perfect unison. A supernatural groove. He took her by the hand. And the room began to spin. He said ""I'm Earth; Earth Brown.. You know the shape I'm in.. ""I'm leavin' tonight for Alaska. And I want you to come in the spring. And be a goddess in the planet wars. And save the living things.. ""I'm ready to go right now"". Sun Green told Earth Brown. ""Let's go back to my place. pick up my cat and leave this town behind."". ""Hey Mr. Clean you're dirty now too.. Hey Mr. Clean you're dirty now too.. Hey Mr. Clean you're dirty now too.. Hey Mr. Clean."". Next day Sun Green got busted for pot. And it made the headline news. But then the charges all got dropped. And the story gets confused. â€˜I'd still like to meet Julia Butterfly. And see what remedy brings. And be a goddess in the planet wars. Try to save the living things. ""But that might not be easy. Livin' on the run. Mother Earth has many enemies. There's much work to be done. ""Hey Mr. Clean you're dirty now too.. Hey Mr. Clean you're dirty now too.. Hey Mr. Clean you're dirty now too.."

The jaws that bite the claws that snatch!. Beware the Jubjub bird and shun. The frumious Bandersnatch!"". He took his vorpal sword in hand:. Long time the manxome foe he sought â€”. He rested 'neath the Tumtum tree. And stood awhile in thought.. And while in uffish thought he stood. The Jabberwock with eyes aflame. Came whiffling through the tulgey wood. And burbled as it came!.

1588,It's a second hand story no one wants to hear. And it's wet with blood salted with tears. It's black and white and red all over. Happens all the time. This was something about an artificial heart. She lived in a sleepy town trailer home park. Where not many people go out after dark. Innocent helpless at 17. Queen of every loser's wet dream. Which brings us to our villain but a mother could love. He liked amputation and the Lord above. He kidnapped her on her way home from school. She lost her mind he lost his cool. She didn't tell him about the artificial heart. ?? then some kid found her head. Then an arm and a leg and you know the rest they said. The artificial heart it was still beating. With a needle and a thread they sewed on her head. She's alive and well like she was never dead. She doesn't remember the day she didn't die. Or how everybody cried. She read a story in the paper how she was victimized. And you should have seen the look in her eyes. Her assailant was acquitted and as she read. I swear she laughed off her head.
1590,We are young. But we have heart. Born in this world as it all falls apart. We are strong. But we don't belong. Born in this world as it all falls apart. I see the children in the rain like the parade before the pain. I see the love I see the hate I see this world that we can make. I see the life I see the sky Give it all to see you fly. Yes we wave this flag of hatred but you're the ones who made it. Watch the beauty of all our lies passing right before my eyes. I hear the hate in all your words all the words to make us hurt. We get so sick oh so sick we never wanted all this. Medication for the kids with no reason to live. So we. March to the drums of the dammed. as we come. Watch it burn in the sun - we are numb. We are young. But we have heart. Born in this world as it all falls apart. We are strong. We don't belong. Born in this world as it all falls apart. As we walk among these shadows in these streets these fields of battle. Take it up we wear the medal raise your hands with burning candles. Hear us whisper in the dark in the rain you see the spark. Feel the beating of our hearts fleeting hope as we depart. All together walk alone against all we've ever known. All we've ever really wanted was a place to call our home. But you take all we are; the innocence of our hearts. Made to kneel before the alter as you tear us apart. So we. March to the drums of the dammed. as we come. Watch it burn in the sun - we are numb. We are young. But we have heart. Born in this world as it all falls apart. We are strong. We don't belong. Born in this world as it all falls apart. We will fight or we will fall. Till the angels save us all. We will fight or we will fall. Till the angels save us all. We will fight or we will fall. Till the angels save us all. We will fight or we will fall. Till the angels save us all. We are young. But we have heart. Born in this world as it all falls apart. We are strong. We don't belong. Born in this world as it all falls apart. We are young. But we have heart. Born in this world as it all falls apart. We are strong. We don't belong. Born in this world as it all falls apart
1593,History repeats the old conceits. The glib replies the same defeats. Keep your finger on important issues. With crocodile tears and a pocketful of tissues. I'm just the oily slick. On the windup world of the nervous tick. In a very fashionable hovel. I hang around dying to be tortured. You'll never be alone in the bone orchard. This battle with the bottle is nothing so novel. So in this almost empty gin palace. Through a two-way looking glass. You see your Alice. You know she has no sins. For all your jealousy. In a sense she still smiles very sweetly. Charged with insults and flattery. Her body moves with malice. Do you have to be so cruel to be callous. And now you find you fit this identikit completely. You say you have no secrets. And then leave discreetly. I might make it California's fault. Be locked in Geneva's deepest vault. Just like the canals of Mars and the great barrier reef. I come to you beyond belief. My hands were clammy and cunning. She's been suitably stunning. But I know there's not a hope in Hades. All the laddies cat call and wolf whistle. So-called gentlemen and ladies. Dog fight like rose and thistle. I've got a feeling. I'm going to get a lot of grief. Once this seemed so appealing. Now I am beyond belief.
1595,All the towers of ivory are crumbling. And the swallows have sharpened their beaks. This is the time of our great undoing. This is the time that I'll come running. Straight to you. For I am captured. Straight to you. For I am captured. One more time. The light in our window is fading. The candle gutters on the ledge. Well now sorrow it comes a-stealing. And I'll cry girl but I'll come a-running. Straight to you. For I am captured. Straight to you. For I am captured. Once again. Gone are the days of rainbows. Gone are the nights of swinging from the stars. For the sea will swallow up the mountains. And the sky will throw thunder-bolts and sparks. Straight at you. But I'll come a-running. Straight to you. But I'll come a-running. One more time. Heaven has denied us its kingdom. The saints are drunk howling at the moon. The chariots of angels are colliding. Well I'll run babe but I'll come running. Straight to you. For I am captured. Straight to you. For I am captured. One more time.
1597,I can't breathe and arrive. with style. i'm still a sucker. feeding it pills. with wine it's tricky how. i'm pushin you back but still you ain't gone. pushing you back but still you ain't gone. pushing you back but still you ain't gone. it makes some sense look. i can't breathe and her eyes are dry. but still i will fuck her to keep alive. plus my arms are still broke. but watch me. push you back but still you ain't gone.

1598,You can say the soul is gone. And the feeling is just not there. Not like it was so long ago.. On the empty page before you. You can fill in what you care. Try to make it new before you go.. Take the simple case of the serge. Who can't go back to war. 'Cause the hippies tore down everything that he was fighting for.. Or the lovers on the blankets. That the city turned to whores. With memories of green kissed by the sun.. You can say the soul is gone. And close another door. Just be sure that yours is not the one.. And I'm singing for the stringman. Who lately lost his wife. There is no dearer friend of mine. That I know in this life.. On his shoulder rests a violin. For his head where chaos reigns. But his heart can't find a simple way. To live with all those things.. All those things. He's a stringman. A stringman. All those strings to pull. .
1602,Gotta make a move to a. Town that's right for me. Town to keep me movin'. Keep me groovin' with some energy. Well I talk about it. Talk about it. Talk about it. Talk about it.

Won't you take me to. Funkytown. by YzzaLaiene
1605,Goin' back where I was born. Goin' back where I can carry on. African town is really suped. Doin' the world as you do. All the african women around. They're gonna rock and shake on down. Shake yourself shake yourself. Rock yourself. . She's alright she's in the groove. Watch that little girl how she moves. They're all doin' that on the borderline. Shake yourself like I shake mine
1608,I miss you so much I can't stand it. Seems like my heart is breaking in two. My head says no but my soul demands it. Everything I do reminds me of you. I miss you so much in this house full of shadows. While the rain keeps pouring down my window too. When will the pain recede to the darkness. From whence it has come and I'm feeling so blue. Ain't goin'down no more to the well. Sometimes it feels like I'm going to hell. Sometimes I'm knocking on your front door. But I don't have nothing to sell no more. Seems like the spirit is pushing me onwards. I'm able to see where I tripped and went wrong. I'll just have to guess where my soul will find comfort. And I miss you so much when I'm singing my song. Ain't goin' down no more to the well. And sometimes it seems I'm going to hell. You'll find me knocking on your front door. But I don't have nothing to sell no more. Seems like my spirit is pushing me onwards. 'Til I'm able to see where I tripped when I went wrong. I'll just have to guess where my soul will get comfort. I miss you so much when I'm singing my song. I miss you so much I can't stand it. Seems like my heart is breaking in two. My head says no but my soul demands it. And everything I do reminds me of you. Everything I do reminds me of you. Everything I do reminds me of you.

But she knows what she know. Give that girl wings and that's all she wrote. Twilight zone (2x). I'm floating in the dark alone and. Is there any love out here let me know. A laser lights pinpoints the top of my dome. Then through my body. As if Scotty's beaming up a wayward soul. Mutant races in an ancient universe. Dark shadows humans rhymin' in a raggae verse. It's gone if you blink. I can see it as soon as you think it. Dancehalls crystal balls. On sidewalk malls. Psychic people outdoors reading palms. I believe that you know more. To survive the dimension if four. Oh prisoner. My pretty oh oh prisoner. Look at the way she's searching. Trapped in a world that's hurting. So bad it makes her cry. But I won't let her say good bye.

1630,"That's the place I used to work. When I was a wild young turk. It's now the Museum of Industry. Schoolkids get in for free. Brickworks-smell of rotten eggs. Rubber works poured out the dregs. Now it smells of Dettol and pee. Lotteryland's the place to be. Where the steelmill used to stand. There's a park in Lotteryland. Be a pram-pusher on parole. Go windsurfing on the dole. They can put you right to sleep. Better than Brookside or The Street. It's lucky numbers one two three. Lotteryland's the place to be. We don't care who runs the shop. Left wing right wing curse the lot. A million quid talks sense to me. Lotteryland's the place to be. Now gone is dirt and gone is strife. And gone is struggle and gone is life. ""Shove it mate I'm busy see"". Lotteryland's the place to be. Now we triple lock the doors. Streets are full of thieves and whores. In a padded cell eternity. Lotteryland's the place to be. Lotteryland's the place to be. Lotteryland's the place to be"

When the leaves come falling down. In September when the leaves come falling down. Follow me down follow me down follow me down. To the place beside the garden and the wall. Follow me down follow me down. To the space before the twilight and the dawn. Oh the last time I saw Paris in the streets in the rain. And as I walk along the boulevards with you once again. And the leaves come falling down. In September when the leaves come falling down. Follow me down follow me down follow me down. To the place between the garden and the wall. Follow me down follow me down. To the space between the twilight and the dawn. And as I'm looking at the colour of the leaves in your hand. As we're listening to Chet Baker on the beach in the sand. When the leaves come falling down. Woe in September when the leaves come falling down. Oh when the leaves come falling down. Yeah in September when the leaves come falling down.

1637,In the morning I wake up. And in the night I sleep. Since the day that I was born. Repeat repeat repeat. Brought to this life. Born to this life. Where was I before?. Non-existent? Not at all?. Will I ever know?. Today is my birthday. And I get one every year. And some day…. Hard to believe. But I’ll be buried six feet underground. Subconsciously motivated natural instinct. Alter nature for the pleasure. Orthocycline. Flirt with conception. Slow the cycle. Will the baby grow?. Social tradition interference. Control control control. Today is my birthday. And I get one every year. And some day…. Hard to believe. But I’ll be buried six feet underground. I’ll be dead and gone no longer around. Spinning spinning. Before I can recall. All the unknown chemicals. Control the cycle. The successive generations. From dust to dust. Burying my grandma. Then give birth to my own daughter. Today is my birthday. And I get one every year. And some day…. Hard to believe. But I’ll be buried six feet underground. Today is my birthday. And I get one every year. And some day…. Hard to believe. But I’ll be buried six feet underground. I’ll be dead and gone no longer around. I’ll be buried six feet underground
1639,Van Morrison. Exile Publishing Ltd / Universal Music Publishing Ltd. Little village baby ain't large enough to be a town. From a little village baby ain't large enough to be a town. Gotta get away from the city. It's gonna bring you down. Heard the voice of the silence in the evening. In the long cool summer nights. Heard the voice of the silence in the evening. In the long cool summer nights. Telling me not to worry. Everything's gonna be all right. There's only two kinds of truth. Baby let's get it straight from the start. There's only two kinds of truth. Let's get it straight from the start. It's all what you believe. Baby in your head and your heart. Heard the bells ringing. Voices singing soft and low. Heard the bells ringing. Voices are singing soft and low. Way up in the mountain little village in the snow. Raining in the forest. Just enough to magnetise the leaves. Raining in the forest. Just enough to magnetise the leaves. Weâ€™ll go walking baby with the moonlight shining down through the trees. Little village way up on the mountainside. Little village baby way up on the mountainside. Way across the ocean with you by my side.
1640,Words and music by Freddie Mercury. Do you mean it do you mean it do you mean it. Why don't you mean it why do I follow you. And where do you go?. Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah. You've never seen nothing like it. No never in your life. Like going up to heaven. And then coming back alive. Let me tell you all about it. Oooh give me a little time to choose. Water babies singing in a lily pool delight. Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night. Here comes the Black Queen poking in the pile. Fi fo the Black Queen marching single file. Take this take that bring them down to size. March to the Black Queen. Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys. Little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a-baby oil. Black on black on every finger nail and toe. We've only begun - begun. Make this make that keep making all that noise. Ooh march to the Black Queen. Now I've got a belly full. You can be my sugar baby. You can be my honey chile. A voice from behind me reminds me. Spread out your wings you are an angel. Remember to deliver with the speed of light. A little bit of love and joy. Everything you do bears a will. And a why and a wherefore. A little bit of love and joy. In each and every soul lies a man. And very soon he'll deceive and discover. But even to the end of his life. He'll bring a little love. Ah ah ah ah ah. I reign with my left hand I rule with my right. I'm lord of all darkness I'm queen of the night. I've got the power now to do. The march of the Black Queen. My life is in your hands I'll fo and I'll fie. I'll be what you make me I'll do what you like. I'll be a bad boy I'll be your bad boy. I'll do the march of the Black Queen. Ah ah ah ah ah. Walking true to style she's vulgar abuse and vile. The Black Queen tattoos all her pies. She boils and she bakes. And she never dots her I's. La la la la la la la la la la la la. La la la la la. Forget your sing a-longs and your lullabies. Surrender to the city of the fireflies. Dance to the devil in beat with the band. To hell with all of you hand in hand. But now it's time to be gone. La la la la forever forever. Ah ah ah ah ah
1641,Sweet love sweet love. Trapped in your love. I've opened up I'm sure I can trust. My heart and I were buried in dust. Free me free us. You're all I need when I'm holding you tight. If you walk away I will suffer tonight. I found a man I can trust. And boy I believe in us. I am terrified to love for the first time. Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?. I've finally found my way. I am bound to you. I am bound to you. So much so young I've faced on my own. Walls I built up became my home. I'm strong and I'm sure there's a fire in us. Sweet love and so pure. I catch my breath with just one beating heart. And I embrace myself please don't tear this apart. I found a man I can trust. And boy I believe in us. I am terrified to love for the first time. Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?. I've finally found my way. I am bound to you. I am bound to you. Suddenly the moment's here. I embrace my fears. All that I have been carrying all these years. Do I risk it all? Come this far just to fall?. Fall. I have entrusted and boy I believe in us. I am terrified to love for the first time. Can you see that I'm bound in chains?. And finally found my way. I am bound to you. I am ooh I am. I'm bound to you
1643,This is a tune for the poparazzi. The who's who and the so and so's. This is a tune for the graven images. Of Marilyn Monroe. We saw your face on the magazine. We heard the song on the MP3. You're stuck in my head. Stuck in my head. Stuck in my head. You can close your ears and your eyes but. Pop will never leave you alone. Leave me alone with your social mingle. You try so hard to stay on top. Leave me alone with your little jingle. With your picture perfect pop. We read the article in Seventeen. We saw your video on MTV. This is a tune for the late Nirvana. The teen spirit rock and roll. This is a tune for the velvet Elvis's. On the 90210. I thought my eyes were gonna get off clean. Till I read your lips on the TV screen. You were busy saying what you didn't mean. Now everyone's singing along. With your ridiculous song. You got it stuck. You got it stuck in my head.
1644,Here comes that feeling again. you're always around me. this island life never ends. it just circles inside me. and when we're older. we'll go back to being friends. but oh. here comes that feeling again. i better get away from all these. oh-so-familar places that i see. i gotta find a place without so many. familar faces in front of me. when i wake up in the morning. and there's no one there but me. i'll remember. i'll remember. here comes that feeling again. you're always around me. this island life never ends. it just circles inside me. and when we're older. we'll go back to being friends. but oh. here comes that feeling again. gotta keep on moving through these. distances between yesterday and now. as if all this riding on these white lines. will make them fade away somehow. do you try not to remember. the things you cannot forget. and are you sorry for what hasn't happened yet. i stare at everyone. it makes me wonder why. i can't see anyone but you. maybe change. and all these faces. reappear in different places. and i can't see a thing but you. here comes that feeling again. you're always around me. this island life never ends. it just circles inside me. and when we're older. we'll go back to being friends. but oh. here comes that feeling again
1646,Maya this song's for you. I have your name print tattooed upon my skin. There's so much to say to you. And where do I begin?. Cos all these prayers must be going somewhere. Somewhere I can never trace. But it seems so far look in the stars. And the empty space. Chorus:. There are worlds within worlds that keep rotating. And so many thoughts that flow through my mind. If this universe is really shrinking. We'll be together in time. I had a vision of this place. It looked like heaven but the colours seemed to change. And no matter what I do yeah. It's slowly fading away. So all of these prayers have to be going somewhere. Somewhere I can never trace. And one could get lost in all of these stars. And drift in space. Chorus:. There are worlds within worlds that keep rotating. And so many thoughts that flow through my mind. If this universe is really shrinking. We'll be together in time. Chorus:. There are worlds within worlds that keep rotating. And so many thoughts that flow through my mind. If this universe is really shrinking. We'll be together in time. Chorus:. There are worlds within worlds that keep rotating. And so many thoughts that flow through my mind. If this universe is really shrinking. We'll be together in time.
1648,September seventeen. For a girl I know it's Mother's Day. Her son has gone alee. And that's where he will stay. Wind on the weathervane. Tearing blue eyes sailor-mean. As Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain. For a boy in Fiddler's Green. His tiny knotted heart. Well I guess it never worked too good. The timber tore apart. And the water gorged the wood. You can hear her whispered prayer. For men at masts that always lean. That same wind that moves her hair. Moves a boy through Fiddler's Green. Ohhhh nothing changed anyway. Ahh nothing's changed anyway. Ahh anytime the day. He doesn't know a soul. And there's nowhere that he's really been. But he won't travel long alone. No not in Fiddler's Green. Balloons all filled with rain. As children's eyes turn sleepy-mean. And Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain. For a boy in Fiddler's Green.

Now every new song on the radio reminds him of her. He says hello to strangers and he's singing in the shower. The sign in his eyes says this guy's got a problem so nice so nice. She don't know what she's doing to him. Every day's like Christmas it sure ain't a dream. When a man's in love when a man's in love. he'll fight like a tiger fly like a dove when a man's in love. He's early on the job and all his friends begin to sense. his attitude has changed he's serene and contented. His feet don't touch the ground he can hardly wait to see her tonight.

1667,"(M. Jagger/K. Richards). Hannah honey was a peachy kind of girl. Her eyes were hazel. And her nose were slightly curved. We spent a lonely night at the Memory Motel. It's on the ocean I guess you know it well. It took a starry to steal my breath away. Down on the water front. Her hair all drenched in spray. Hannah baby was a honey of a girl. Her eyes were hazel. And her teeth were slightly curved. She took my guitar and she began to play. She sang a song to me. Stuck right in my brain. You're just a memory of a love. That used to be. You're just a memory of a love. That used to mean so much to me. She got a mind of her own. And she use it well. Well she's one of a kind. She's got a mind. She got a mind of her own. And she use it mighty fine. She drove a pick-up truck. Painted green and blue. The tires were wearing thin. She turned a mile or two. When I asked her where she headed for. ""Back up to Boston I'm singing in a bar"". I got to fly today on down to Baton Rouge. My nerves are shot already. The road ain't all that smooth. Across in Texas is the rose of San Antone. I keep on a feeling that's gnawing in my bones. You're just a memory of a love. That used to mean so much to me. You're just a memory girl. You're just a sweet memory. And it used to mean so much to me. Sha la la la la. She got a mind of her own. And she use it well. Mighty fine she's one of a kind. On the seventh day my eyes were all a glaze. We've been ten thousand miles. Been in fifteen states. Every woman seemed to fade out of my mind. I hit the bottle and hit the sack and cried. What's all this laughter on the 22nd floor. It's just some friends of mine. And they're busting down the door. Been a lonely night at the Memory Motel."

I'll get attention from somebody else. I don't know what your intentions are. I have no patience to be put on the shelf. Mmm baby. You say you love me. Then you don't even know if I'm around. And baby. If you're not lying. Then keep trying or I'll be gone. [Chorus]. Baby if you show me now. There may still be time. To change my heart. But baby. If you don't need me. You'll both leave me. When your cryin' starts. [Repeat chorus]. .
1680,Bye bye baby. Take me on a highway. This time it could be heaven. Even for a little while. Didn't want to miss you. Maybe I can make you feel fine. I don't know what you want me to do. But I'm losing control of my senses. And I know I've been counting on you. Just to show that you really care. I can see that your star is ascending over me. But I don't wanna go there. 'Cause I'm feeling so scared. I've had enough of this love. And you calling the shots. Outta thin air. And I'm full of emotion. When you don't believe me. 'Cause baby here comes a crash. And I'm dying inside. When you leave me. I don't know what you're putting me through. But it seems that the party is over. In and out of love with you. And I think that I'm losing my mind. I can see that your star is ascending over me. But I don't wanna go there. 'Cause I'm feeling so scared. I've had enough of this love. And you calling the shots. Outta thin air. And I'm full of emotion. When you don't believe me. 'Cause baby here comes a crash. And I'm dying inside. When you leave me. But I don't wanna go there. 'Cause I'm feeling so scared. I've had enough of this love. And you calling the shots. Outta thin air. And I'm full of emotion. When you don't believe me. 'Cause baby here comes a crash. And I'm dying inside. When you leave me. But I don't wanna go there. 'Cause I'm feeling so scared. I've had enough of this love. And you calling the shots. Outta thin air
1681,I was an idiot in utero. somehow missed New Mexico. fell to earth in Baltimore I know. Now they lay case in empty rooms. birthday cards and red balloons. and me I know I know I know I know. I invited Johnny Legs and Jackie-O. Empty parties filled with people I don't know. I am rich and in the radio. I dream on my TV. dislocation dislocation. I'm fading out in stereo. I don't remember me. dislocation dislocation. telling lies and taking shots. getting laid in parking lots. getting high and getting caught I know. All my broken paper planes. parachutes and window panes. I'm a shooting star gone novocaine I know. So I write to all the girly magazines. Splash my passion on the pages in between. I am rich and in the radio. I dream on my TV. dislocation dislocation. I'm fading out in stereo. I don't remember me. dislocation dislocation. Rising from the afterglow. a dodo bird with polio. and me I know I know I know I know. I play with a rock and roll band on a subway. It keeps me far away from the gamma rays. We lit between the boom boom crash and the fade away. I know. Come on wake up the congregation. we will see the light tonight. the spark the flash the bang the bite. I know I know I know know. know know know know know. I am rich and in the radio. I dream on my TV. dislocation dislocation. I could fade away in stereo. and you won't remember me. dislocation dislocation. If they dropped a bomb on London. swallow LA with the sea. dislocation dislocation. Say a prayer for Oklahoma. say another one for me. dislocation dislocation

1688,"on one morning. in the month of May. when all the birds. were singing. I saw a lovely maiden stray. across the fields at break of day. she softly sung her roundelay. the tide flows in. the tide flows out. twice every day returning. her cheeks were red. her eyes were brown. her hair in ringlets hanging down. upon her face to hide the frown. just as the tide was a flowing. the tide flows in. the tide flows out. twice everyday returning. a sailor's wife at home must bide. she halted heavily she sighed. ""he parted from poor me  a bride. I'm widowed by the sea"" she cried. just as the tide was a flowing. the tide flows in. the tide flows out. twice every day returning."
1690,Many pages in a story book. About love between two people like us. It's just a feeling golden moments. In a world without time. I can see easily. The beauty that's surrounding you. Is reaching out to touch my very soul. In my imagination the world is what we make it. And our love is all we need to carry on. In my imagination our time is spent together. And our love is all we need to stay alive. Some people passing never look at us. As we run along just chasing the wind. Another morning I will dress you. In the sunshine of my love. I can see (I can see) easily (Easily). The beauty that's surrounding you. Is reaching out to touch my very soul. In my imagination the world is what we make it. And our love is all we need to carry on. In my imagination our time is spent together. And our love is all we need to stay alive. So much time I wasted searching. I was always on my own. Now the world is never ending with you. In my imagination the world is what we make it. And our love is all we need to carry on. In my imagination our time is spent together. And our love is all we need to stay alive
1691,Walking down on Main Street. Cold chills in the air. Looking for a helping hand. Ainâ€™t nobody there. Dreams nightmares and fantasies. Weave their way around. I can see past appearances. They canâ€™t bring me down. . Chorus:. But tell me. Who loves you. When youâ€™re down and out. And youâ€™re all alone. Who loves you. When youâ€™ve lost your mind. And you lose control. . Television radio and all the magazines. Focus on the negative. Time and time again. Young men give their lives away. Believing in a cause. Ware is always profitable. They write you off a loss
1693,Cold Cold Night. . I saw you standing in the corner. On the edge of a buring light. I saw you standing in the corner. Come to me again in the cold cold night. In the cold cold night. You make me feel a little older. Like a full grown women might.. But when you gonna grow colder. Come to me again in the cold cold night. In the cold cold night. I hear you walkinâ€™ by my front door. I hear the creakinâ€™ of the kitchen floor. I donâ€™t care what other people say. Iâ€™m gonna love you anyway. Come to me again in the cold cold night. In the cold cold night. I canâ€™t stand it any longer. I need the fuel to make my fire bright. So donâ€™t fight it any longer. Come to me again in the cold cold night. In the cold cold night. And I know that you feel it too. When my skin turns into glue. You will know that itâ€™s warm inside. And youâ€™ll come run to me. In the cold cold night. In the cold cold night. In the cold cold night. In the cold cold night

Don't want no disrespect cuz we all know the score. but you need to put time in at the common sense store. Yes yes y'all youre brainwashed all in your head. Let's make one thing crystal clear. we don't want (need) no ism here. Now you say you hate me and you're not ashamed. it's just insecurity that's causing you pain. Well if you can't get past that we are not the same. then realize that ism is a part of the blame. Racism-we don't want it here. Sexism-we don't need it here. Fascism-we don't want it here. Keep that ism out of my ear. Terrorism-we don't want it here. Leftism-we don't need it here. Fakeism-we don't want it here. We don't want it  we don't need it.
1698,I Could paint the sun and the moon. And the stars straight down from the sky. Carve your likeness in stone. Down to the light that shines in your eyes. Build a church in your honor. Stained glass windows facing east. Loving you is my masterpiece. Love you for who you are. I love you for who you may never be. From downtown all the way up to 142nd street. And all of my possessions mean less than the very least. Loving you is my masterpiece. There's no time like now. There is no place like here. So throw your loving arms around me dear. And I'll lean on you like a beggar. Leans upon the moonlit streets. Loving you is my masterpiece
1699,When it rains it pours and opens doors. Then flood the floors we thought would always keep us. safe and dry. And in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips. into the ones we love. That have to say goodbye. And as I float along this ocean. I can feel you like a notion that won't seem to let. me go. Cause when I look to the sky something tells me. you're here with me. And you make everything alright. And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me. you're here with me. And I can always find my way when you are here. And every word I didn't say that caught up in some. busy day. And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't have. before. And every sunset that we'll miss I'll wrap them all. up in a kiss. And pick you up in all of this when I sail away. while I float upon this ocean. I can feel you like a notion that I hope will never leave. Cause when I look to the sky something tells me. you're here with me. And you make everything alright. And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me. you're here with me. And I can always find my way... Whether I am up or downor in or outor just plane. overhead. Instead it feels like it is impossible to fly. But with you I can spread my wings. to see me over everything that life may send me. When I am hoping it won't pass me by. And when I feel like there is no one that will ever. know me. There you are to show me. When I look to the sky something tells me. you're here with me. And you make everything alright. When I feel like I'm lost something tells me. you're here with me. And I can always find my way when you are here
1700,I... I used to fly. Didn't matter where I'd been. 'Cause I'd seen the sky. I wanna tell you why. But somehow I know I. Would break down and cry. I know you can't see me here. But I am not alone. I'm lying here in invisible arms. And I won't be alone tonight. You... you know I would die. Before I let them see me. See me cry. Please don't leave tonight. Oh let me down slowly. Show me a light. I know you can't see me here. But I am not alone. I'm lying here in invisible arms. And I won't be alone tonight. Oh let me think I'm strong. Please don't bring me down. I need you tonight. I know you can't see me here. But I am not alone. I'm lying here in invisible arms. And I won't be alone tonight. I... I used to fly. Didn't matter where I'd been. 'Cause I'd seen the sky

1704,Chorus:. It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you. But when we are apart I feel it too. And no matter what I do I feel the pain. With or without you. Baby I don't understand. Just why we can't be lovers. Things are gettin' out of hand. Tryin' too much but baby we can't win. Let it go. If you want me girl let me know. I am down on my knees. I can't take it anymore. Chorus.

1706,It has always been in the back of my mind. Dreaming about going to the corners of time. I always wanted to fly in strange machines. I wanna do centuries in a lifetime. And feel it with my hands. Touch the world war II and Cleopatra. Flying.... Could it be that my dream would come true. Building a machine that would actually do. What I want it to do. Russian revolution let's do that in one day. Beethoven and Gershwin I think that would be o.k.. More than anything I wanna fly in strange machines. I wanna do centuries in a lifetime. And see it with my eyes. Watch Jesus rise if he ever did. Flying.... I wanna do centuries in a lifetime. And feel it with my hands. Touch renaissance and Chaka Khan. Flying...
1708,If somebody asked you to surrender. And that was the only way to win. If somebody offered you the freedom to open. Your mind again. Would you take that flight. Would you walk right in. So meet me down at the bottom line. And open my heart with your hands. And we'll hear the sound of pretenses falling. And find where the truth has been. Down at the bottom line. If somebody led you to the water. If somebody taught you (right?) how to swim. If somebody took your doubt and turned it out. And then you could breathe again. Would you take that chance. Would you dive right in. So meet me down at the bottom line. And open my heart with your hands. And we'll hear the sound of pretenses falling. And find where the truth has been. Down at the bottom line. What if the wind blows. The cradle will fall. What if the wise man knows nothing at all. We justify. We crucify. But we don't have the balls to cry. So meet me down at the bottom line. And open my heart with your hands. And we'll hear the sound of pretenses falling. And find where the truth has been. Down at the bottom line. That's where we'll go. Where truth always flows
1712,Thinking of you. It all comes in view. I believe we came from the same cloud. Two drops in the ocean. Tell me again. The story of when we. We will be together one day. We're two of a kind. Forever we've been combined. Though the current will pull us apart. Two drops in the ocean. You are part of me. The other side of the sea. And we will be together one day. Hey hey. What can I say?. I swim your way. Though the tide pull us away. I ask you. What you gonna do?. Oceans apart. But I know no one else will do. Two drops in the ocean. Just go with the motion dear. We'll meet again. From two rivers that dealt on two shore. Two drops in the ocean. Fall into me. Dissolve in the sea. The boundaries between they are nothing. But love we have the only real thing... yeah. There is a stone wall. Around your heart. Nothin left now to do but to start. Chippin away. Day by day. Until we see it break apart. Hear me talkin 'bout. Let it be known it can be done. Bit by bit and one by one. If the two of us try from both the two sides. Until we see the sun. You're phenomenal. Two drops in the ocean. Just go with the motion. A lot of fish in the sea. Not for me. You're somethin' of a different kind. The rest evaporate but you stay in my mind. There is a stone wall. Around your heart. Nothin left now to do but to start. Chippin away. Day by day. Until we see it break apart. Hear me talkin 'bout. Let it be known it can be done. Bit by bit and one by one. If the two of us try. From both the two sides. Until we see the sun. Your phenomenal. Hey hey. What can I say?. I swim your way. Though the tide pull us away. I ask you. What you gonna do?. Oceans apart. But I know no one else will do. Two drops in the ocean. Just go with the motion. Two drops in the ocean dear
1714,"Doctors have come from distant cities just to see me. Stand over my bed disbelieving what they're seeing. They say I must be one if the wonders of God's own creation. And as far as they see they can offer no explaination. Newspapers ask intimate questions want confessions. They reach into my head to steal the glory of my story. They say I must be one if the wonders of God's own creation. And as far as they see they can offer no explaination. Chorus:. Oooh I believe that Fate smiled and Destiny. Laughed as she came to my cradle. ""Know this child will be able"". Laughed as my body she lifted. ""Know this child will be gifted with love with patience. and with faith she'll make her way she'll make her way"". People see me I'm a challange to your balance. I'm over your heads how I confound you. and astound you to know I must be one if the wonders of God's own creation. And as far as you see you can offer no explaination. Oooh I believe that Fate smiled and Destiny. Laughed as she came to my cradle. ""Know this child will be able"". Laughed as she came to my mother. ""Know this child will not suffer"". Laughed as my body she lifted. ""Know this child will be gifted with love with patience. and with faith she'll make her way she'll make her way"". ""She'll make her way"". Ooooh hoo hoo hoo ooooh hooo hooo hoo."
1715,You told me so if I don't let go. I'll never know what enjoying freedom means. I told you so as the past will go. Turn your heart back to the land. As the sun will shine and the 'decline. There's a truth to hear. So open wide. If your mind is slow. There's no intervene. When you're being itched. When you reach that. They still run my heart. They still run my heart. They still go to the skies. Take one step beyond
1717,The sky is gonna cry tonight. Flowing like a river it softly slips away. The sun won't shine so bright. Cos she knows it'll never start another day. Nothing lasts forever. It comes as no surprise. We were strong together. Now I realize oh please just. Give me one more day I've got to have my say. I'm not afraid to feel the fear and do it anyway. No I'm never giving up cos I haven't had enough. Of all of the love feel the fear and do it anyway. Anyway. Gonna say hello to my soul today. Sitting on a mountain saying goodbye to the sun. Before you throw it all away. I'd like to say sorry for all the things I've done. Nothing lasts forever. It comes as no surprise. We were strong together. Now I realize oh please just. Give me one more day I've got to have my say. I'm not afraid to feel the fear and do it anyway. No I'm never giving up cos I haven't had enough. Of all of the love feel the fear and do it anyway. Do it anyway. Found the line that I like in my book of life. When I'm searching for the truth. There's a time and a place for sacrifice. But I don't want to. Just give me one more day I've got to have my say. I'm not afraid to feel the fear and do it anyway. No I'm not giving up cos I haven't had enough. Of all of the love feel the fear and do it anyway. Just give me one more day I've got to have my say. I'm not afraid to feel the fear and do it anyway. No I'm not giving up cos I haven't had enough. Of all of the love feel the fear do it anyway. Do it anyway. Do it anyway
1718,No one ever thought this one would survive. Helpless child gonna walk a drum beat behind. I lock you in a dream I never let you go. I never let you laugh or smile not you. Well I just want to walk right out of this world. 'cause everybody has a poison heart. I just want to walk right out of this world. 'cause everybody has a poison heart. Making friends with a homeless torn up man. He just kind of smiles it really shakes me up. There's danger on every corner but I'm okay. Walking down the street trying to forget yesterday. Well I just want to walk right out of this world. 'cause everybody has a poison heart. I just want to walk right out of this world. 'cause everybody has a poison heart. A poison heart a poison heart a poison heart... yeah!. You know that life really takes its toll. And a poet's gut reaction is to search his very soul. So much damn confusion before my eyes. But nothing seems to phase me. And this one still survives. I just want to walk right out of this world. 'cause everybody has a poison heart. I just want to walk right out of this world. 'cause everybody has a poison heart. Well I just want to walk right out of this world. 'cause everybody has a poison heart. A poison heart a poison heart a poison heart. A poison heart a poison heart a poison heart

1747,"Stumbled my way on the darkest afternoon. I got a beer in my hand and I'm draggin' a stoogie too. The back of my brain is tickin' like a clock. Well I simmer down gently but boil on what the fuck. I get back 'cause I'm feelin' good tonight. I get back 'cause I'm feelin' right. Trouble is a word that starts with a capital T. And I refer myself to the word 'cause I'm so keen. Little do they know that I'm struttin' such a style. It makes the trouble in me all worth the while. I get back 'cause I'm feelin' good tonight. I get back 'cause I'm feelin' right. There goes Billy and Susie walkin' hand in hand. Well I quickly caught up slurring ""Yo what's the plan?"". They had fear in their eyes and bellies that ran like dogs. I barreled down laughing screaming ""Susie you forgot your clogs"". Well old Mr. Heffer I'm really pleased to meet you. I didn't mean to scare your blue eyed child. But Billy didn't talk to me and Susie wouldn't look at me. It made me so doggone crazy I had to chase them for a mile. All I wanted was change for a buck. Well I'm back and I'm feelin' good tonight. Well I'm back and I'm feelin' right. Well I'm back and I'm feelin' good tonight. Well I'm back and I'm feelin' right Jesus"
1751,That's the way love goes. Hhmmm. Like a moth to a flame. Burned by the fire. My love is blind can't you see my desire. That's the way love goes (goes). My love is blind can't you see my desire. Don't mind if I light candles. I like to watch us playing. Baby you've got on what I like. Come closer baby closer. Reach out and feel my body. I'm gonna give you all my love. Oh sugar don't you hurry. You've got me here all night. Just close your eyes and hold on tight. Oh baby don't stop don't stop. Go deeper baby deeper. You feel so good I'm gonna cry. (Ooohhh) I want to take you there. Ooohohhoho. That's the way love goes. (repeat)
1752,Standing on a rooftop. Trying to clear my mind. I only came up to look. But now there’s such a crowd.. I don’t feel that bad. Cant help but laugh. And they cry out. They say jump and I say how high?. I feel my body blowing. From every side to side. My mind cant help but knowing…. What it feels like to fly.. I don’t feel that bad. Cant help but laugh. And they cry out. They say jump and I say how high?. Say jump and I say I might.. And they cry out. And they cry out. Say jump and I say I’ll try. Say jump and I say I’ll say goodbye. Say jump and I say how high?. High fly.. Fly.. I’m just standing. On the edge of. Something I should try to hide from.. I don’t know much but I know something. I need to try and find me a way. Try I always come out fighting. I don’t feel I should deny me.. Cant help knowing what is down there. Feels I should fly now for them. I’m fascinated mis-educated its reincarnation. Of my imagination I’m far away from here today. It’s where I’ll stay if I get my way. It’s lying awake that makes me sane. But it makes me sick but I cant change again..
1753,I was only asking for a moment of the truth. I can't fight the feeling. when I'm hanging out with you. Why do I forgive you. Because I get confused. I could never leave behind the part of me. that you refuse. Ooh. I was on the ceiling I could almost feel the sun. Try the words in sequence. but that's never how it's done. Why do our disasters creep so slowly into view. I was only after a friend to follow through. I couldn't lose. I know why you don't really know me. I don't think you can call it home. All alone I couldn't taste another thing. I was on the ceiling and I swore it might be true. I could fight the feeling. but not quite as well as you. I don't know won't you come and show me. I don't think it's what you did before. All alone I couldn't take a case like you
1754,I know I ask for nothing. And thatâ€™s what I got from you tonight. I guess I thought youâ€™d changed. Leaving becomes too easy. Easy by morning light. I still cannot explain. Is it enough to ask and not receive. Just one more kiss before you turn and leave. When love is over. Over it should be. But something still burns in me. A hundred solid reasons. The answers come in waves. But I'm all for calmer seas. Youâ€™re only lost in the shuffle. But in your usual way. Itâ€™s you who always comes to me. Iâ€™ve burned up pages. Hidden yesterdays. Hereâ€™s one more glance before I turn away. When love is over. Over it should stay. But something wonâ€™t go away. Hardly a moment passes. Hardly a single day goes by. Iâ€™m not remembering. Just to surrender slowly. Into a strangerâ€™s arms. But you stand watching in the wings. These must be days weâ€™ve seen through tear-filled eyes. It all makes painful sense when I realize. When love is over. Something has to die. Cause you can say goodbye.
1755,I will love you till the day that I die. I will love you till the day that I die. You walked into the room. The sun hit my eyes. The force you struck me down caught me by surprise. You sprung the mojo and it worked like a charm. I felt invincible with you in my arms. I must confess it can feel good to feel clean. Like breaking waves or getting caught in the rain. Playing those games cause we had nothing to do. I was oblivious I was losing to you. I will love you till the day that I die. I will love you till the day that I die. I will love you till the day that I die. I will love you till the day that I die. Holy Jesus. Holy rock’n’roll. The more I gave to you the more you devoured. And making love became the waging of war. No peace. No tenderness. No fun anymore. I will love you till the day that I die. I will love you till the day that I die. I will love you till the day that I die. I will love you till the day that I die. I dreamt that I called out your name. You turned your face to me and started to say. Something so beautiful it hurt deep inside. So I will love you till the day that I die. Farewell. Farewell. I'm sure gonna leave you (I will love you till the day that I die). Farewell. Farewell. I'm sure gonna leave you (I will love you till the day that I die). Farewell. Farewell (I will love you till the day that I die). I'm sure gonna leave you (I will love you till the day that I die). Farewell. Farewell (I will love you till the day that I die). I'm sure gonna leave you (I will love you till the day that I die). Farewell. Farewell (I will love you till the day that I die). I'm sure gonna leave you (I will love you till the day that I die). Farewell. Farewell (I will love you till the day that I die).
1756,When somebody thinks you're wonderful. What a difference in your day. Seems as though your troubles disappear. Like a feather in your way. When somebody thinks you're wonderful. Tells you with a smile so sweet. What are little stones you step on. Just a meadow 'neath your feet. And how you meet the morning. And gaily swing along. At night you may be weary. But your heart still sings a song. When somebody thinks you're wonderful. Love is mighty close to you. Just another thing more wonderful. Making all her dreams come true. And how you meet the morning. And gaily swing along. At night you may be weary. But your heart still sings a song. When somebody thinks you're wonderful. Love is mighty close to you.

Kicks off his shoes. As he studies the form. Of every appealing soubrette. But where are the flowers that he used to bring?. Every endearing remark. Reminds her of passionate promises. That he only made in the dark. In her bed. She wants to shout at the back of his head. Look at me look at me look at me. I'm afraid. See what it's come to. I'm just your mistress and maid. The wine is warm. But the dinner is cold. The look in his eye tells her it won't be long. Till the girls on the page come to life. And they'll get the flowers that he used to bring. With every endearing remark. And all of the passionate promises. He'll never fulfil in the dark. In their bed. She wants to shout at the back of his head. Look at me look at me now that I'm not afraid.. See what it's come to. I'm not your mistress and maid. See what it's come to. I'm not your mistress and maid."

1783,There you are. In a darkened room. And you're all alone. Looking out the window. Your heart is cold. And lost the will to love. Like a broken arrow. Here I stand in the shadows. Come to me. Come to me. Can't you see that. (Chorus:). Nobody wants to be lonely. Nobody wants to cry. My body's longing to hold you. So bad it hurts inside. Time is precious and it's. Slipping away. And I've been waitin' for you all of my life. Nobody wants to be lonely. So why. Why don't you let me love you. Can you hear my voice. Do you hear my song. It's a seranade. So your heart can find me.

Something is there. This guiding light. Will burn so bright. So much wonder around us. All the love in the air. Let the good that surround us. Help us to always care. In this world where ever present dangers. Circle round our family heart. Like a throng of hostile strangers eager. for a way to start. There appears a friend's familiar face. Oh sweet relief the heart goes to a warmer place. And this we prize. And this we hold so dear. This state of grace. We may find a trace. Of this state of grace. In the saddest face. Something is there. How the rivers flow. We may never know. But it goes to show. Something is there. This guiding light. Will burn so bright. So much wonder around us. All the love in the air. Let the good that surround us. Help us to always care. Life aboard this fast revolver still remains. a magic mistery. Loud reports of anger fill the pages of our history. Those of us with love can now embrace. With sweet relief a life lived at a gentler place. And this we prize. And this we hold so dear. This tumble state of grace. In the night a daffodil. Is battered by the father of all storms. daybreak sees it stand alone. Amongst a field of lifeless forms. Rays of light illuminate. Where sweet relief presents a shinig yellow face. And this we prize. And this we hold so dear. This humble state of grace. We may find a trace. Of a state of grace. In the saddest face. Something is there. How the rivers flow. We may never know. But it goes to show. Something is there. This guiding light. Will burn so bright. So much wonder around us. All the love in the air. Let the good that surround us. Help us to always care. Then the seeds we sow. Will survive and grow. And we all will know. Something is there. This guiding light. Will burn so bright. So much wonder around us. All the love in the air. Let the good that surround us. Help us to always care. And this we prize. And this we hold so dear. This humble state of grace
1809,"If you want my love. He gotta do what he does. If you want these sweet light sugar Gucci lips. He gotta give it up. I know you think I'm cool. But I ain't one of the boys.

1811,[verse 1]. When I feel beated down. And I get burned out. I flip another card. And things finally start to look up. Some hearts need to fail. Some ships were built to sail without you. Whoa. [chorus]. Don't look back although you might be sorry. The test is out to finish your story. Do your best to give pride. With sense of reason. And realize. That change comes with the season. Don't look back!. [verse 2]. It's not about the race. It's more about the pace. Sometimes you walk away. But sometimes you have to stand up. For what you believe and I can guarantee. You'll finally feel free. [chorus]. Don't look back although you might be sorry. The test is out to finish your story. Do your best to give pride. With sense of reason. And realize that change comes. With the season. Don't look back!. [verse 3]. So when you feel like giving up. No one cares about your love. Remember up above. Someone's telling you try to see. Without only using your eyes. [chorus]. Don't look back although you might be sorry. The test is out to finish your story. Do your best to give pride. With sense of reason. And realize that change. Comes with the season. [x2]
1813,With laughing eyes I do recall. Every face that crammed thish all. And in this room our hats wereh ung. And words were written and songs were sung. And we held our glasses high. And we dared to reach for the sky. And we never would grow old. When we were the new boys. And on these streets we were like kings. We'd roll and tumble fight and sing. And in these smoky pubs the yarns were spun. And many a sweetheart was lost and won. And on these green fields we played for pride. No quarter given no compromise. We were lovers and we were sons. When we were the new boys. Behind this cellar door on cheap guitars. We played our blues to the early hours. No one listening but a few old friends. We never dreamed it could ever end. This was our moment this was our space. This was a jewel of a time to have graced. But they're all sweet memories now. When we were the new boys. All my life I've been running. Down the side of this hill. But way down deep in my heart. Don't want the water to ever be still. All these friends have long since gone. Blown and scattered like autumn leaves. Some are lawyers and some are thieves. Some are long behind the sun. But I'll never be afraid. From the cradle to the grave. I learned my lesson and I learned it well. When we were the new boys. When we were the new boys.
1815,Save the planet for another day. Attention shoppers. Buy with a conscience and save. Save the planet for another day. Save Alaska!. Let the caribou stay. Don't care what the governments say. They're all bought. and paid for anyway. Save the planet for another day. Hey Big Oil!. What do you say?. We were runnin' through the night. Never knowin' if we would see the light. Paranoid schizophrenic visions. Livin in fear of the wrong decisions. We got to wake up. We got to keep goin'. If they follow us. There's no way of knowin'. We got a job to do. We got to save Mother Earth. Be the ocean when it meets the sky. You can make a difference. If you really try. Be the magic in the Northern lights. Six Days. Six nights. Be the river as it rolls along. It has three-eyed fish. And it's smellin' strong. Be the rain you remember fallin'. Be the rain. Be the rain. Yeah rain was fallin' and we're soakin' wet. Hail is beatin' down on our heads. The wind is blowin' through our hair. Faces frozen in the frigid air. We got to get there. Alaska. We got to be there. Before the big machines. We got a job to do. We got to save Mother Earth. Dream the hunter on the western plain. The birds are all gone. Where did they go?. Dream the fisherman in his boat. He's comin' home empty. He's barely afloat. Dream the logger in the great northwest. They're runnin' out of trees. They got to give it a rest. (There's no other way to cut it). Dream the farmer in the old heartland. Corporate greed and chemicals. are killin' the land. Next mornin' Sun was up at dawn. She looked around and Earth was gone. Dark visions he had last night. He needed peace he needed light. He heard the rumble and. He saw the big machines. The green army rose. It was a bad dream. He had a job to do. He had to save Mother Earth. Be the ocean when it meets the sky. Greek freighters are dumping. crap somewhere right now. Be the magic in the northern lights. (The ice is melting!). Be the river as it rolls along. Toxic waste dumpin'. from corporate farms. Be the rain you remember fallin'. Be the rain. Be the rain. Save the Planet for another day. Be the rain. Be the rain. Be the river as it rolls along. Be the rain. Be the rain

That it'll be a good day a good day for us. Thank you thank you thank you. Let me count the ways how I miss you. It's like that oak tree in my childhood garden. It's like that first summer I spent in Egypt. It's like that warm evening you read to me. Both knowing deeply. That it's a good time a good time for us. Thank you thank you thank you.

I wanna take a step across that line. ´Till you can feel my love. . You opend the door and it hits to the core. . Ain´t got no pearls or diamond rings. I only got my heartbeat. But it won´t be long and I will win. And melt inside your heart. . You opend the door and it hits to the core. . We went too far way too far. There´s no turning back this time. We went too far way too far. But you´re gonna be all mine. . You opend the door and it hits to the core. . We went too far way too far. There´s no turning back this time. We went too far way too far. But it´s gonna be allright. . We went too far way too far. It can never be too far. We went too far way too far. To find nothin´ but real love.

Was my last brick. Lent to finish her. Finish her. She lived like a murder. How she'd fly so sweetly. She lived like a murder. But she died. Just like suicide. Bit down on the bullet now. I had a taste so sour. I had to think of something sweet. Love's like suicide. Safe outside my gilded cage. With an ounce of pain. I wield a ton of rage. Just like suicide. With eyes of blood. And bitter blue. How I feel for you. I feel for you

But they'll surely come around. Flashes of pink and flashes of gold. And a distant and joyful sound when pigs fly. Fly-yy. I know for a dreamer. Cause I've been a dreamer too. You got that faraway look in your searching eyes. And a heart that's steady & true. Are we suddenly seen a dozen remor?. Sailing in the clear blue sky. The time has come when pigs fly. Yeah it's a beautiful thing when pigs fly
1846,"I got a letter just the other day. She sent a picture but she didn't sign her name. She wore high heels and a little black lace. I knew her body but I couldn't see her face.

Baby let's put the X in sex. Keep it undercover baby let me be your private eye. I got a call in the middle of the night. Heavy breathin' never sounded quite so nice. She said ""Oh yeah I wish that I was there"". I asked who was calling but she wasn't playing fair. Sometimes you gotta suffer for the pleasure that you seek. You're beggin' for an eyeful but you only get a peek. Baby let's put the X in sex. Love's like a muscle and you make me wanna flex. Baby let's put the X in sex. Keep it undercover baby let me be your private eye. I heard somebody knockin' so I opened up the door. She wore a hat shades and a trench coat. Wasn't wearin' that much more.

1853,This is my toothpaste moment. Oh I'll need to flash a smile.. I'll be the super-absorbent-man. Watch them flock to me in single file.. And I'll need to do it with style. I need to keep me up to date. Swallowing the sun run another mile. It's overrated how we underrate.. I dance in tune with what I fear. To do adrenaline. Completely rapt with what I hear. When passion colors everything. The songs I sing from way out there to deep within. The face I wear behind my grin. The price I pay for my original sin. Everything everything everything.... I have a mind for simple things. But things are not of mind to simplify;. There's always some loophole technicality. You buy into and pay until you die.. And money doesn't bring me joy. It's more a darling dead weight. And I seem to have lost my appetite. It's underrated how we overrate.. I dance entangled with my dear. She pulls my every string. Completely trapped yet never here. When passion colors everything.... And when I'm finally brought to my senses. Parade the rain on my parade.. Before I'm back to my defenses. To watch the whole thing escalate

1868,Catch your breath. Hit the wall. Scream out loud. As you start to crawl. Back in your cage. The only place. Where they will. Leave you alone. 'Cause the weak will. Seek the weaker until they've broken down. Could you get it back again?. Would it be the same?. Fulfillment to their lack of strength. At your expense. Left you with no defense. They tore it down.. And I have felt the same as you I've felt the same. As you I've felt the same. Locked inside. The only place. Where you feel sheltered. Where you feel safe. You lost yourself. In your search to find. Something else to hide behind. Cause the fearful always preyed upon your confidence. Did they see the consequence?. They pushed you around?. The arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones. Breaking them 'til they've become. Just another crown. And I have felt the same as you I've felt the same. As you I've felt the same as you I've felt the same.. Refuse to feel. Anything at all. Refuse to slip. Refuse to Fall. Can’t be weak. Can’t stand still. You watch your back. 'Cause no one will. You don’t know why they had to go this far. Traded your worth for these scars. For you're only Company. Don’t believe the lies that they have told to you. Not one word was true. You’re alright you're alright. You’re all right. And I have felt the same as you I've felt the same. As you I've felt the same as you I've felt the same.

1879,Ours is just another skin. That simply slips away. You can rise above it. It will shed easily. It all will come out fine. I've learned it line by line. One common wire. One silver thread. All that you desire. Rolls on ahead. Like a ship in a bottle. Held up to the sun. Sails ain't going nowhere. You can count every one. Until it crashes unto the earth. And simply slips away. You can hide in the open. Or just disappear. Ours is just a craving. And a twist of the wrist. Will undo the stopper. With abrupt tenderness. Die little sparrow. And awake. Singing. It all will come out fine. I've learned it line by line. One common wire. One silver thread. All that you desire. Rolls on ahead

1884,Lovely and loveless. And lonely as the moon.. She sits at the bar that clips her wings. And slips through the cracks of the room.. The rest are all preoccupied. Just talking about this and that -. But just around the corner sit right down. ‘Cos everything’s gonna be grand.. Oh a streetlight shines the brightest before morning. Then fades away as the dawn becomes noon.. Oh and while all your trying’s fine. Your light is tinny and slight. The sun’s gonna rise and make a fool of you!. I’m sure you were a star once. But now you’re just a worthless as me!. But when you’ve been made up all of your life. Is there anything that’s underneath?. And maybe I’m the shallow one. But I’ve got no reason to be fair -. So just around the corner sit right down. ‘Cos everyone’s hanging out there.. So lovely and loveless. I guess the story is true:. That you can kiss the boys and make ‘em cry. But there’s always someone meaner than you!. And the rest would not abstain from you. If you hadn’t treated them so bad -. But just around the corner sit right down. ‘Cos everythings’s gonna be grand.. Oh and everyone’s gonna be glad.. Everything’s gonna be…

1897,"Maybe I need some rehab. or maybe just need some sleep. I got a sick obsession. I'm seeing it in my dreams. I'm looking down every alley. I'm making us desperate 'cause. I'm staying up all night hoping. And hitting my head against the wall. What you got boy it's hard to find. I think about it all the time. I'm all strung out my heart is fried.

1898,Chestnuts roasting on an open fire. Jackfrost nipping at your nose. Yuletide carols being sung by a choir. And folks dressed up like eskimos. Everybody knows. Some holly and some mistletoe. Will help to make the season bright. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow. Will find it hard to sleep tonight. They know that Santa's on his way. He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh. And every mother's child is gonna spy. To see if reindeers really know how to fly. And so I'm offering this simple phrase. To kids from one to ninety-two. Although it's been said many times many ways. Merry Christmas to you. And so I'm offering this simple phrase. To kids from one to ninety-two. Although it's been said many times many ways.

1901,We can't seem to let go. The thread's so thin it just doesn't show anymore. It seems like we're playing charades. Playing like we're afraid to live. And this is one sacrifice I don't want to make. If there's no end. There can be no beginning there can be no beginning. If there's no end. It feels like forsaking the dawn we awaken and still we don't see. I am still secretly grateful you're living this moment with me. We can see where it leads. It's like you can't can't kill the monster that feeds on you. No matter what you do it seems to get you every time. And that's a predicament if I know anything. If there's no end. There can be no beginning there can be no beginning. If there's no end. It feels like forsaking the dawn we awaken and still we don't see. I'm still secretly grateful you're living this moment with me. Secretly grateful you're sharing this moment with me. If it's just one life we're given one time you're living. I feel your touch light up a wild desire. Borne on my ache to take us ever higher. In our love we are birds of prey. Every cry serves to lead astray. So carry my ache and you will know the feeling. Inside I am weak but for this love I'm bearing. So breathe your life in my shades of grey. Or kill the lights and we'll fade away. By: VaaL Silva
1903,Coming back from Paris on the train. I really didn't care if the journey took all day. Try to turn the pages of my magazine. Whilst trying to keep a hold of your hand and. Ordering a coffee that I wouldn't ever drink. Just to keep you and Paris on my mind. Just to keep you and Paris on my mind. I didn't know it would be the last time. The last time I saw you. At Waterloo we went our separate ways. When I got in my cab. I didn't turn and wave. I didn't go to work. Just went to bed. Trying to keep you and Paris on my mind. Trying to keep you and Paris on my mind. I didn't know it would be the last time. The last time I saw you. I phoned your office this afternoon. They said they hadn't heard anything from you. It's been seven days without a word. I have to keep you and Paris on my mind. I have to keep you and Paris on my mind. I didn't know it would be the last time. The last time I saw you.

I didn't know it would be the last time. The last time I saw you. The last time I saw you. The last time I saw you. The last time I saw you
1904,Look at the man in the corner he's sitting all alone. His blankets are made out of cardboard. And his pillows are made out of stone. Every face tells a story it never tells a lie. Every face tells a story it never tells a lie. See the man walking on the water see the light in his eyes. He came into the world with a message to tell. He came into the world to die. Every face tells a story it never tells a lie. Every face tells a story it never tells a lie. You're always telling stories you're always telling me lies. You're always telling stories why?. So think of yourself in the water seeing your days flashing by. It's too late to see what you wanted to be. You've spent all your time you must die. Every face tells a story it never tells a lie. Every face tells a story it never tells a lie oh. You're always telling stories you're always telling me lies. You're always telling stories why?. . Why don't you step down. And make it work out right. I'm trying to get to you with my warning. Been here. For nearly half the night. Look it's nearly four in the morning.......

1908,Many plans that I've had have been thrown out the window hopes and dreams. And devious schemes have ended bad well you know. How it is and the way I live are secrets closely guarded. Any chances of being romantic are slim and soon discarded. Why should I sleep within its opening time it seems like I've been here all my life. I don't know what it is but it's in her blood. It's when I get home is when she starts up. Biting and scratching is all she does biting and scratching when making love. Biting and scratching there's no use saying you're tired. Biting and scratching would you call me a liar?. My first love is thinking 'bout just how far can I go. With the ins and outs and where abouts it just gets right up her nose. What is next and I suspect she don't know what she started. Before you know it she'll go and blow in the land of the dear departed
1909,But over in a land that's in my back yard. There's a people who succeed they don't try hard. Well they've found a way to live with ease. Eating from the bush instead of the tree. Apple bush apple tree. Path to eternity. Find you a path and you follow the call. Apple bush apple tree. Back to eternity. Cut you a path with a chance may might fall. Move over in a corner standing there. Telling my house that they haven't a single care. But my house doesn't worry it's got a path of it's own. And a bush and a tree. Never leave it alone. Apple Bush apple tree. Back to eternity. Find you a path and you buy with a car. Apple bush apple tree. Back to eternity. Cut you a path with a chance may might fall. Someday like my house you're going to chose too. If you cut this new path well the old one will do. If you live with the people who live with ease. The red apple bush the blue apple tree.

And I fill my face 1 know that things have got to you. But what can 1 do?. Suddenly without a warning. On a pale blue morning. You decide your time is wearing thin. A conscious choice to let yourself go dangling. Hovering. It's an emergency. There's no more ""wait and see"". Maybe if I shut my eves. Your trouble will be split between us. People come and people go. You're scouring everybodies face. For some small flicker of the truth. To what it is that you are going through my boy. I left you dry. The signs were clear that you were not going anywhere. Anywhere. Save for a falling down. Everything's going wrong. Later on as I walked home. The plough was showing and orion. 1 could see the house where you lived. I could see the house where you gave. All your time and sanity to people. Then you waited for the people to acknowledge you. They spoke in turn. But their eyes would pass over you. Over you. Who's seeing you at all?. Who's seeing You at all?"
1918,Watch the watch the way I walk. Can't you think my movements talk. Watch the watch the way I walk. Can't you think my movements talk. See me silently quietly creep I am too. amped up to sleep lamp rays shining down. Street lamps make the bussing sound subway. Creaking down below garbage piled up and ready to go. Lock the windows the gates on taxi in the. Distance coming along stalking the streets. Till the break of day New York beauty take my. Breath away near some cats but dog's don't. bark cool cats strolling after dark. Watch the watch the way I walk. Can't you think my movements talk. Watch the watch the way I walk. Can't you think my movements talk. Shaky lock and kicky door smokey air that. I adore down in the alley is where I hunt. All is quiet on the eastern front. Stalking the streets till the break of day. New York beauty take my breath away. Watch the watch the way I walk. Can't you think my movements talk. Watch the watch the way I walk. Can't you think my movements talk. Can't you think my movements talk.
1919,He picked her up some flowers. On a sunday afternoon. They sat out on the porch swing. Underneath the cresent moon. Life times seemed to pass. Staring at the skies. And on the swing he gave her the ring. There were tears in her eyes. He said I pray I'm not alone. In my dreams about forever. You and I could become one. And always be together. We'd grow old and wise. Through all the days. For worse or for better. And now the truth cause I love you. Even now more than ever. And a lifetime flies but we'll fly farthur. Into the night where the eyes of loneliness can never bother. All our dreams of together uneclipsed by never never. Lifetime finds it's in your eyes but we'll fly farther. Fifty years have ridden off into the sunset. And the tears that we have cried have overflown. Here we are acounting scars wounds of life and ending upsets.

And we'd sleep oh so close. But not really close our eyes. Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue.... Gently weeping nights. It was long long ago. And I still can't touch your name. For the days of fate were strong for you.... Danced you far from me. In my madness. I see your face in mine. I keep a photograph. It burns my wall with time. Time. An Occasional Dream. Of mine. An Occasional Dream. Of mine. An Occasional Dream. Of mine

Thank you for the vision of truth – you’ve shown me the world like I’d never seen. How right and wrong are clear as day – but the color of justice is green. Good luck in the afterlife – don’t forget to bring what ya got paid to. Good luck in the afterlife – don’t forget the pictures of those poisoned by you. Thank you for making me stare into the dark and focus on the ugliest scene. Where right and wrong are too clear to see and all you’re looking for is green. Good luck in the afterlife – don’t forget to rot in your empty shell. Good luck in the afterlife – don’t forget the way you made this life Hell. Thank you for the taste of blood pressed from the life between my teeth. When right and wrong were chewed away – and you left the taste of grief. Remember all the people you showed no love to.. Remember all the people you drove to hate you.. Remember all the people you were a disease to.. Remember all the people you wouldn’t say please to.. Remember all the people that offered compassion.. Remember all the people that you turned your back on.. Remember when you sold your last decency. When you’re done remember me.

I got away just in the nick of time that's why. I powdered my nose in Oklahoma. Over the top. I wasted away in New Orleans. I couldn't stop. Down in the alley - happy dust. Me and Romona we was gettin' bust. I got away just in the nick of time that's why. I got the nickname the Gypsy Roadhog. On the California trail. I gotta keep my wheels movin' on. I gotta keep me outa jail. Powdered my nose in San Francisco. Down on the bay. It went to my head down in New York City. I was blasted away. And two ugly scuts bust in the room. They took away my little silver spoon. I got away just in the nick of time that's why. (CHORUS). I'm comin' through through through. I'm looking for you

1970,All my friends are drunk in a sense of flame. Will I see them again?. I dream of dreams to come and temples built with love. I'm not a slave.. This city lights are fading calling me again. Like diamonds in the rain. Where prophets tag their name her rivers filled with shame. Few faces stay the same.. The time will never end the larger truth is in. My skies will show again.. My fire works ignite the spirit now takes flight. And have the glory fame.. I don't mess around. Throw your weapon to the ground. Now witches gather round. They have to make no sound.
1973,Sick and tired of bleedin' for picking up the pieces. So I let 'em fall down let 'em fall down. Runnin' outta reasons to hold down the demon. So I'm lettin' it out lettin' it out.

1975,If the folks next door to me weren't so good. I'd do all the mean things anybody could. I'd drink and I'd gamble and I'd louse around. I'd be the meanest man in this whole town. If I hadn't seen the light in that old lady's eyes. I'd try to be a man you would hate and despise. I'd rave and I'd rant and I'd scream and yell. And I'd chase my neighbors from here to hell. If I hadn't heard those kids laugh playing games. I'd have nervous fits I'd go insane. I'd turpentine cats and tin can dogs. I'd smother people to death inside of hollow logs. If the people around me wasn't so nice. I'd freeze my heart into a cake of ice. Steal money from soldiers and working folks too. I'd lend you a dollar and take back two. If my wife didn't kiss me the way she does. I'd carry four or five daggers and three or four guns. I'd shoot craps and ramble and hang out late. I'd steal baby buggies and Cadillac Eights. If my friends didn't write me those letters I get. I'd be a dictator the worse one yet. I'd be the only smart bird you'd all be fools. Send you all away to war and I'd stay home and rule. If it wasn't for them songs I hear you all sing. I'd put a crown on my dome and I'd say I'm your king. I'd kidnap some and blackmail others. I'd peddle black market stuff and rob sisters and brothers. If it weren't for your talking I hear on the street. I'd be the orneriest man that you ever did meet. I'd preach the gospel of hate and I'd drink your blood. But I can't be this bad because my folks are too good. No I can't be this bad because my folks are too good

1989,All roads they lead to shame. All drowning in the blame. All reflections look the same. In the shine of the midnight revolver. All hide beneath a skin. A hope so paper thin. I'm at the door again. And the shine of the midnight revolver. Even the promise of danger has gone dull. Staring down the barrel of a 45. Suck on the barrel. Suck on the barrel. Suck it 'til it's gone dry. For all reflections look the same. In the shine of the midnight revolver. Redemption purify. Will nothing satisfy. The scars just multiply. In the shine of the midnight revolver. Twisting in apocalypse. Death upon the fingertips. Frigid metal touches lips. And the shine of the midnight revolver. 'Cause you lied. Just a bullet away. Just a bullet away from leavin' you. Just a bullet away. Stop the voices in my head. Caressing death again. Becomes the heroin. Forbidden medicine. Puts a shine on the midnight revolver. Eternal borderline. All the faces intertwine. Oh God now I see mine. In the shine of the midnight revolver. Even the promise of danger has gone dull. Staring down the barrel of a 45. Suck on the barrel. Suck on the barrel. Suck suck 'til it's dry. For all reflections look the same. In the shine of the midnight revolver. Down In Misery. Down In Misery. Just a bullet away. Just a bullet away from leavin' you. Just a bullet away. Stop the voices in my head. All roads they lead to shame. All drowning in the blame. Reflections look the same. In the shine of the midnight revolver. All hide beneath a skin. A hope so paper thin. I'm at the door again. And the shine of the midnight revolver. Even the promise of danger has gone dull. Staring down the barrel of a 45. Suck on the barrel. Suck on the barrel. Suck suck 'til it's dry. Do all reflections look the same. In the shine of the midnight revolver. 'Cause you lied. Yes you lied. Just a bullet away. Just a bullet away from leavin' you. Just a bullet away. Stop the voices in my heads
1990,Do you see what they are. Do you hear what they say. People it is sad but true. They're dressed really stupid. But they think they're O.K.. And they got no use for you. The dead girls of London. Why do they act that way?. Maybe it's the water mama. Maybe it's the tea. Maybe it's the way they was raised. Maybe it's the stuff what they read in the papers. Keeps them lookin' sorta half in a daze. Well the dead girls of London. Why do they act that way?. We're the dead girls of London. We thinks we are fine. We ain't hittin' on nothin'. But the boutique frame of mind. You see 'em dancing at the disco every night. Like a bunch of little robot queens. Making little noises full of fake delight. But they're really just so full of beans. The dead girls of London. Why do they act that way?. We're the dead girls of London. We thinks we are fine. We ain't hittin' on nothin'. But the boutique frame of mind. Boutique frame of mind. Gee I like your pants. Boutique frame of mind. Gee I like your pants. Boutique frame of mind. Gee I like your pants.
1991,Saw my young face on a picture. Would he recognise me now?. Oh but I doubt it. For he was fierce fierce and unforgiving. Saw her young face on that picture. She really had the horniest eyes. Now they are blunted. Blunted with living. Living with compromise. Time deal us all compassion. These cards are for other men. Back here in rebel land we've all the failure we can stand. Back here in rebel land we've all the failure we can stand. Back here in rebel land we've all the failure we can stand. Back here in rebel land we've all the failure we can stand. Back here in rebel land. Some might say we're disappointed. Some might say we were betrayed. Ahh nothing doin'. That's how it goes. That's how it's played. There's nothing world exclusive about losing a worldly cause. Back here in rebel land we've all the failure we can stand
1992,Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming. Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights. Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming. The goddess of imaginary light. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby (paper flowers). I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me (paper flowers). I linger in the doorway of alarm clock screaming. Monsters calling my name. Let me stay. Where the wind will whisper to me. Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story. If you need to leave the world you live in. Lay your head down and stay a while (paper flowers). Though you may not remember dreaming. Something waits for you to breathe again (paper flowers). In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby (paper flowers). I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me (paper flowers). . . [by:Gothika And Léo]
1993,I dont wanna change the subject. But its all that I can do. I think you will agree there is more of us. Than the sum of all of you. Let me get a read on the moment. So I can tell you what I see. I set my sights on something more. But I settle for less than me. Oh oh oh. Feed me lies againmy soul. I dont wanna come back here anymore. Running on the last excuses. Of a world that knows my name. How am I supposed to make my mark. If I still cant make my way?. I focus on the next illusion. Someone else is in my place. Theres is just so much that you can take. But I mind my on my face. Oh oh oh. Feed me lies againmy soul. I dont wanna come back here anymore. Oh oh oh. Stay right here and leave me alone. I dont wanna come back here anymore. Anymore. I dont wanna be a burden. But I know the chance I had. Everybody wants what they dont need. And they envy drive you mad. So turn around and keep walking. I can find my way from here. I set my sights on an epitaph. And I settle for all my fears. Oh oh oh. Feed me lies againmy soul. I dont wanna come back here anymore. Stay right here and leave me alone. I dont wanna come back here anymore. Oh oh oh. Feed me lies againmy soul. I dont wanna come back here anymore
1994,The things you did. I never saw them. I only picked up. What I found. The deeds you hid. How could I miss them. They're floating free. All over town. When all screamed high. I whisper low. Always the last to know. Suspicious calls. I wasn't listening. I never felt that insecure. Memorise. I wasn't reading. I wansn't ready to be sure. I was just a puppet on your late show. Always the last to know. (Chorus:). Sister sister brother brother. Bring out the blessing human touch. You run so fast. I was so slow. Always the last to know. Please forgive me. Of being foolish. That's how I am. How 'bout you. I close my eyes. And keep on cherish. God in one. Was once so true. Our love left freezing in the snow. Always the last to know. Sister sister brother brother. Bring out the blessing human touch. You run so fast. I was real slow. Always the last the last to know. Sister sister brother brother. Bring out the joy I miss so much. You place me with grace. In your darkest shadow. And I was always the last to know. Always the last to know (2x). To know...
1996,"She's right peculiar. She'll try and fool ya. But the Girl Keeps Coming Apart. She's so appealing. Right off the ceiling. But the Girl Keeps Coming Apart. What did I tell ya. She'll buy and sell ya. 'Cause the Girl Keeps Coming Apart. She's so affected. I'm so rejected. And the Girl Keeps Coming Apart. Don't don't don't don't let it get me down. Don't let it get me down. She's just a screamer. A nightmare dreamer. Yeah the Girl Keeps Coming Apart. She's like a call girl. Loose ends and all girl. But the Girl Keeps Coming Apart. White lace and leather. She's so together. But still the Girl Keeps Coming Apart. I feel sedated. Boxed up an crated. 'Cause the Girl Keeps Coming Apart. Don't don't don't don't don't don't. Don't let it get me down. Don't let it get me down. ""So there she was. Buns up and kneelin'. I was a wheelin' and a dealin'."
1997,Stop pushing me. I never felt like this before. It's just something in me. I need to close another door. Live my life to suit me. I just can't hide the confusion that burns in my mind. Oh no. Sometimes the pressure gets so high. Excuses come so easy. Just like a man lies to his wife. When honesty won't please her. I guess you'll find that I'm not what you think you can see. Not what you want me to be?. Chorus:. Stop pushing me. I gotta do it my way. Stop pushing me. Why don't you hear what I say?. Stop pushing me. Cos we all learn from mistakes. Stop pushing me. I'm gonna do it my way. It seemed to me like it won't end. But it was never meant to. Be more than just another trend. A phase that I would go through. You still don't see that I'm not your little baby no more. No. So please don't force me down that road. I'll choose where I'll be going. You can't dictate another day. Don't make me spend one more when. I wanna fight for myself. And be debted to nobody else. No one but myself. (Chorus). My way is the only way I trust. My way whatever the cost. Now don't get me wrong. The respect hasn't gone. But when can I have my say. And do it my way?. (Repeat chorus until fade).
1998,You don't have to be the person actin' like the fool. About time you learned you somethin' so go to school. You never knew you had the answer but that's a lie. Livin' by your intuition and that ain't right. Face first. In the doghouse. Face first. Would not could not should not but you did. Don't even try to cross me you snot nosed kid. This fight ain't half way over you soft skin clown. That ill pill you're selling just wont wash down. I see what you do to others and what you've done. I can't help but think and wonder when my time will come. So when you go for yours you better knock me out. You come back to my neighborhood and I'll bust your crown.
1999,The sky is fallin' and the wheels of life. Are grindin' out a brand new beat. The streets are burnin' with the call of the wild. And I can feel the heat. They'll call you names and spit in your face. But legends never die. Just pick up your guitar. On your knees and pray and hold your head up high. And on the 8th day God created rock and roll. On the 8th day God created rock and roll. Out of the ashes came the dawn and the shape of things to come. Never surrender just carry on straight to kingdom come. You sold your soul and virginity. You can't rape a heart of gold. Yes you're born to rule it's destiny. Now it can be told. And on the 8th day God created rock and roll (rock and roll). And on the 8th day God created rock and roll. And on the 8th day God created rock and roll (rock and roll). And on the 8th day God created rock and roll. Rock of ages carry the news to the heart. Of a brave new world.

Finally if can we just have some time so you can talk to me. Can't you see. That we've no time to waste our lives. And I don't have all the answers. So I close my eyes. And I hope I'm doing right. You and me. In your head we were always gonna be happy. So now we're nothing more than just a memory. So wipe aways those tears and go be strong. I hesitate to tell you what I'm feeling.

But baby let me take you. out on the highway for awhile. I'll show you where the man in me. is when he doesn't hide. He's cruisin' in the fast lane. stuck behind the wheel. Jekyll and Hyde going on inside. when I'm your automobile. And let me be your car for awhile child. shift me into gear and I'll be there. fill me up with five star gasoline. I'll be your car I'll take you anywhere. Don't you know I can't dance. I don't dig it I can't see it at all. You say I'm just a specimen. and baby I can crawl. My physique just don't look. the way the physiques really should. But then again I've got an engine. underneath my hood. When I'm cutting up the road. with a sports car on my tail.

Cause he can hold you he can haunt you. But he won't be thinking of you. Cause he's the man who's already gone. Don't roam. It's a long road. It's a long road with no place to go. There's a man gonna have you if he can. But he don't know which way he's gonna roam..

2016,Dynamic explosions in my brain. Shattered me to drops of rain. Falling from a yellow sky. Orange faces to an opened eye. Stop me. Hold me back as I jerk. Stop me. Voices from all those at work. Lips don't want tô criticize you know. Eyes can never tell you lies. It's the words. Take that fire bring me my brain. Let me love it higher. Why is it so cold out here? (So cold!). Let me in. The price of your entry is sin. Go away then return. Know which face you have to turn. Eyes are glaring voices flaring. Why?. Caught up deep inside beneath my brain. Take my love and turn it to pain. Take my heart and tear it apart. Gonna burn in our desire. Why?. Why?

2029,Called you for the first time yesterday. Finally found a missing part of me. Felt so close but you were far away. Left me without anything to say. Now I'm speechless. Over the edge I'm just breathless. I never thought that I'd catch this. Lovebug again. Hopeless head over heels in the moment. I never thought that I'd get hit. By this Lovebug again. I can't get your smile out of my mind. (I can't get you out of my mind). I think about your eyes all the time. Beautiful but you don't even try. (You don't even don't even try). Modesty is just so hard to find. Now I'm speechless. Over the edge I'm just breathless. I never thought that I'd catch this. Lovebug again. Hopeless head over heels in the moment. I never thought that I'd get hit. By this love bug again. Kissed her for the first time yesterday. everything I wish that it would be. Suddenly I forgot how to speak. Hopeless breathless baby can't you see?. Now I'm. Yeah!. Now I'm speechless. Over the edge I'm just breathless. I never thought that I'd catch this. Lovebug again.

2030,I stick with real things. Usually facts and figures. When information's in its place. I minimize the guessing game. Guess what?. I don't like guessing games. Or when I feel things. Before I know the feelings. How am I supposed to operate. If I'm just tossed around by fate?. Like on an unexpected date?. The stranger who might talk too fast. Or ask me questions about myself. Before I've decided that. He can ask me questions about myself. He might sit too close. Or call the waiter by his first name. Or eat Oreos. But eat the cookie before the cream?. But what scares me the most. what scares me the most. Is what if when he sees me what if he doesn't like it?. What if he runs the other way and I can't hide from it?. What happens then?. If when he knows me he's only disappointed?. What if I give myself away to only get it given back?. I couldn't live with that. So I'm just fine inside my shell-shaped mind. This way I get the best view. So when he sees me I want him to. I'm not defensive. I'm simply being cautious. I can't risk reckless dating. Due to my miscalculating. While a certain suitor stands in line. I've seen in movies. Most made for television. You cannot be too careful. When it comes to sharing your life. I could end up a miserable wife. He could be criminal some sort of psychopath. who escaped from an institution. somewhere where they don't have girls. He could have masterminded some way to find me. He could be colorblind. How untrustworthy is that. He could be less than kind. Or even worse he could be very nice have lovely eyes. And make me laugh come out of hiding. What do I do with that?. Oh God. What if when he sees me. I like him and he knows it?. What if he opens up a door. And I can't close it?. What happens then?. If when he holds me. My heart is set in motion. I'm not prepared for that. I'm scared of breaking open. But still I can't help from hoping. To find someone to talk to. Who likes the way I am. Someone who when he sees me. Wants to again
2031,Going through the motions. Ending up nowhere at all. Can't see the sun on my wall. Going through emotions. Ending up on a frozen morning. With a heart not even broken. Seems I've been running. All my life all my life. Seems I've been running. All my life all my life all my life. Like watercolors in the rain. Find a place to settle down. Get a job in a city nearby. And watch the trains roll on by. I'll find the falling star. I'll fall In love with the eyes of a dreamer. And then a dream worth believing. Seems I've been running. All my life all my life. Seems I've been running. All my life all my life all my life. Like watercolors in the rain. Like watercolors in the rain. Like watercolors in the rain
2032,Bye bye don't cry. I hear you're lying now that everyone is playing here in time. My my don't cry. I'm broken over time and wide awake I never close my eyes. You don't wanna know what it's like to be stuck like meat to bone. And I don't wanna know what it's like to be left here on my own. I'll wait to get you. Away from souvenirs these rumours here have never really shown. I knew a man. Who sailed into Japan and said he wants to drown in the unknown. You don't wanna know what it's like to be stuck like meat to bone. And I don't wanna know what it's like to be left here on my own. What's new. We're not lonely but we miss you. Too bad I'm glad. I'm never really sad you need to know when you can pull the shift. Deny that's why. I never say goodbye and every word's a temporary gift. You don't wanna know what it's like to be stuck like meat to bone. And I don't wanna know what it's like to be left here on my own. You don't wanna know what it's like to be stuck like meat to bone. And I don't wanna know what it's like to be left here on my own. What's new. We're not lonely but we miss you. What's new. We're not lonely but we miss you. What's new.

2033,i will twine with your mingles of raven black hair. with the roses so red and the lilies so fair. with myrtle as bright as the emerald dew. the pale and the lyd-er and eyes of light blue. oh he promised to love me; he promised to love. and to cherish me always all others above.. i woke from my dream and my idol was clay. my passion for loving had vanished away.. oh he taught me to love him; he called me his flower. a blossom to cheer him through life's weary hour. but now he is gone and left me alone. the wild flowers to weep and the wild birds to mourn.. i will dance and i'll sing and my life shall be gay. i will charm every heart and each crown I shall sway. though my heart now is breaking he never shall know. how his name makes me tremble my pale cheeks to glow.. i will dance and i'll sing and my heart will be gay. i'll banish this weeping drive troubles away.. i'll live yet to see him regret this dark hour. when we won and neglected this frail wildwood flower..

2044,Sweep the dirty stairs the ones I waited on.. This is just for me.. I felt it watching her.. It happens too fast to make sense of it.. To make it last.. Where do you intend to go with your dirty dress?. Lead my skeptic sight to the table and the light.. It happened too fast to make sense of it.. To make it last.. Not asking of me anything saying nothing about what it means. without anybody telling me how I should feel. lead my skeptic sight..

2058,I see the sunshine the sunshine sees me. I feel the breezes off of the sea. The palm trees are waving. The sand is so warm. But I’m only dreaming. I’m dreaming alone. Eddie’s dreaming (always dreaming). Eddie’s dreaming (always dreaming). I’m eating banana my friends sit around. I tell them my stories. They won’t make a sound. The girls they’ll be dancing. To the beat of the foam. I’ll smoke and I’ll watch them. When I’m back home
2059,Strange young girls. Covered with sadness;. Eyes of innocence. Hiding their madness.. Walking the strip--. Sweetsoftand placid---. Offering their youth. On the alter of acid.. Thinking these gifts. Were sent by the dove;. All for the trip. Accompanied by love.. Gentle young girls. Holding and walking;. Wisdom flows childlike. While softly talking.. Colors surround them. Bejewling their hair;. Visions astound them. Demanding their share.. Children of Orpheus. Called by the dove--. All for the trip. Accompanied by love.. Thinking these gifts. Were sent by the dove--. All for the trip. Accompanied by love.
2060,"Near to Banbridge Town in the County Down. One morning in July. Down a boreen green came a sweet colleen. And she smiled as she passed me by;. Oh she looked so neat from her two white feet. To the sheen of her nut-brown hair. Sure the coaxing elf I'd to shake myself. To make sure I was standing there. Oh from Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay. And from Galway to Dublin town. No maid I've seen like the brown colleen. That I met in the County Down.. As she onward sped I shook my head. And I gazed with a feeling quare. And I said says I to a passer-by. ""Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?"". Oh he smiled at me and with pride says he. ""That's the gem of Ireland's crown. She's young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann. She's the Star of the County Down."". I've travelled a bit but never was hit. Since my roving career began;. But fair and square I surrendered there. To the charms of young Rose McCann.. I'd a heart to let and no tenant yet. Did I meet with in shawl or gown. But in she went and I asked no rent. From the Star of the County Down.. At the crossroads fair I'll be surely there. And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes. And I'll try sheep's eyes and deludhering lies. On the heart of the nut-brown Rose.. No pipe I'll smoke no horse I'll yoke. Though with rust my plow turns brown. Till a smiling bride by my own fireside. Sits the Star of the County Down."
2061,Before it all gets written down. You've got to re-arrange to create your own illusion of truth. Know that it's good and it's real. Before it all gets written down. You don't have to face the future alone. Everybody has to deal with a tricky situation. Know that it's good and it's real. Before it all gets written down. Love me that's all you have to do. All night long. Show me it's all you have to be. To make it right. You've got your head high up in the clouds. Know you really got to be a down to earth person. Know that it's good and it's real.

2062,I lost myself on a cool damp night. Gave myself in that misty light. Was hypnotized by a strange delight. Under a lilac tree. I made wine from the lilac tree. Put my heart in its recipe. It makes me see what I want to see.... And be who I want to be. When I think more than I ought to think. And do things I never should do. I drink much more than I ought to drink. Because it brings me back you.... Lilac wine is sweet and heady... like my love.... Lilac wine... I feel unsteady... like my love. Listen to me... I cannot see clearly. Isn't that she coming near here?. Lilac wine is sweet and heady... where's my love?. Lilac wine... I feel unready... where's my love?. Listen to me why is everything so hazy?. Isn't that she or my mind is going crazy dear?. Lilac Wine is sweet and heady... Where's my love?. I... I feel unready for my love...

2066,Oh the time will come up. When the winds will stop. And the breeze will cease to be breathin'. Like the stillness in the wind. 'Fore the hurricane begins. The hour when the ship comes in. Oh the seas will split. And the ship will hit. And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking. Then the tide will sound. And the wind will pound. And the morning will be breaking. Oh the fishes will laugh. As they swim out of the path. And the seagulls they'll be smiling. And the rocks on the sand. Will proudly stand. The hour that the ship comes in. And the words that are used. For to get the ship confused. Will not be understood as they're spoken. For the chains of the sea. Will have busted in the night. And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean. A song will lift. As the mainsail shifts. And the boat that drifts on to the shore line. And the sun will respect. Every face on the deck. The hour that the ship comes in. Then the sands will roll. Out a carpet of gold. For your weary toes to be a touchin'. And the ship's wise men. Will remind you once again. That the whole wide world is watchin'. Oh the foes will rise. With the sleep still in their eyes. And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're still dreamin'. But they'll pinch themselves and squeel. And know that it's for real. The hour that the ship comes in. Then they'll raise their hands. Sayin' we'll meet all your demands. But we'll shout from the bow your days are numbered. And like Pharaoh's tribe. They'll be drownded in the tide. And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
2067,Civilization's dying. And no one's realizing. The position of hate stuck inside the gun. Civilization's crying. And I won't try to deny it. We got a problem son. Something's gotta be done. With the Pope. And the president. And the big rockstar who made alot of money. All got one thing in common. They know it ain't no fun to get shot with a gun. Civilization's dying.

2068,All the animals. agree you and me. should be a team. And they walk on parade. say that we were made. to be a team. And my flesh melts beneath your tongue. I am your little comunion. And all the rainbows. Tell me that they know. We're a perfect pair. And the birds up in the sky. Say they can see it from way up high. We're a perfect pair. And my wings weaken beneath your will. And before you I am trembling and still. All the birds know it. One and one is two. All the birds see it. Tell me why don't you. And all the light of the sun. Doesn't help me out none. Cuz you still can't see me.
2069,(Verse). Looking in the mirror. My own reflection. Can't stand to look into my eyes. It's been eating me up. The things we're hiding. I'm so done with those lies. (Verse). Now I've cheated I've miss-leaded baby oh oh. Forgot your birthday it was on Thursday I am so oh. By the time you got you cryin but you know. I'm only human. (Pre-Hook 1). I did some things that I can't erase. I'm not looking for no one to blame. Think it's time I've told you everything. I'm not who you think. (Hook). Now you know who I really am. Now you know where I've been. I'm only hoping that you'll understand. Sometimes I make…. Mistakes. Mistakes. Mistakes. Sometimes I make mistakes. (Verse). I'm so possessive overprotecting. Wanna know who what and where. It's ‘cause I love you. But maybe too much. But I'm only human. (Pre-Hook 2). Now you know what you don't see. Only comes from insecurity. I'm not perfect and I'll never be. I'm not who you think. (Hook). Now you know who I really am. Now you know where I've been. I'm only hoping that you'll understand. Sometimes I make…. Mistakes. Mistakes. Mistakes. Sometimes I make mistakes
2073,I hear the clock it's six a.m.. I feel so far from where I've been. Got my eggs and my pancakes too. Got my maple syrup everything but you. Break the yolks make a smiley face. I kinda like it in my brand new place. I wipe the spots off of the mirror. Don't leave the keys in the door. Never put wet towels on the floor anymore. 'cause. . . Dreams last for so long. Even after you're gone. I know you love me. And soon you will see. You were meant for me. And I was meant for you. . Called my momma she was out for a walk. Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk. Picked up a paper it was more bad news. More hearts being broken or people being used. . Put on my coat in the pouring rain. Saw a movie it just wasn't the same. 'Cause it was happy and I was sad. It made me miss you oh so bad. 'cause. . Dreams last for so long. Even after you're gone. I know you love me. And soon you will see. You were meant for me. And I was meant for you. . Go about my business I'm doing fine. Besides what would I say if I had you on the line. Same old story not much to say. Hearts are broken every day. . Brush my teeth and put the cap back on. I know you hate it when I leave the light on. I pick a book up. And than turn the sheets down. Take a deep breath and a good look around. . Put on my pj's and hop into bed. I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead. I try and tell myself it'll be all right. I just shouldn't think anymore tonight. . Dreams last for so long. Even after you're gone. I know you love me. And soon I know you will see. You were meant for me. And I was meant for you
2076,Skeletal city highs. Crazies with dumb replies. Nobody's eyes anymore. Frown on your beggar's face. Walking this lunarscape. Nothing in my lackaday. Chorus. We'll all be right. We'll all be right. We'll all be right in the now. We all go through. We all go through. We all go through it sometimes. Somebody's space to rent. Somebody's soul to dent. Dog is in every word. Hiding the flames of power. Hiding us home by home. Nearly got out yesterday. Chorus. Trouble it travels on the wing. Doorway to door. Open your eyes. Nothing remains. A secret love between us. Nothing can hide for long. We are the morning song. Holding my breath anyway. Chorus (x2)

2079,Use my breathe for every line you take when you are. lonely words are holy.. a deadly grip on lies sing to these blood red skies.. Hail Mary whisper softly.. What you became. Some things never change and so we. we learn for All Your Hate. we are lost in your mistakes. play our hymn for the brand new day. we burn we learned. Here's your martyr watch her morals bend an empty story. we grow hungry. to reclaim the notes we lent you cannot win.. when saints are glory. I'll die slowly.

2086,It feels like I knew Robert Blink. Even though he didn't know his name. He was so nearly over twenty-one. That he could never feel the same. Well sometimes I wish that I could see. But it was you instead of me. At the eleventh hour [x2]. The trumpets of yesterday are blowing for here today. I only hope you can rest in peace. And cannot hear the tune they play. Because we're all tired of hearing that song. Though they try to make you sing along. At the eleventh hour [x2]. Don't you know you don't need this way?. Can't you see don't you know you have to stay?. Well sometimes I wish that I could see. But it was you instead of me. At the eleventh hour [x2]. If there's more than this I'll write and let you know.

2091,Fight the fight alone. When the world is full of victims. Dims a fading light in our souls. Leave the peace alone. How we all are slowly changing. Dims a fading light in our souls. In my opinion seeing is to know. The things we hold are always first to go. And who's to say we won't end up alone. On broken wings I'm falling. And it won't be long. The skin on me is burning. By the fires of the sun. On skinned knees I'm bleeding. And it won't be long. I've got to find that meaning. That I've searched for so long. Cry ourselves to sleep. We will sleep alone forever. Will you lay me down in the same place with all I love?. Mend the broken homes. Care for them they are our brothers. Save the fading light in our souls. In my opinion seeing is to know. What you give will always carry you. And who's to say we won't survive it too. On broken wings I'm falling. And it won't be long. The skin on me is burning. By the fires of the sun. On skinned knees I'm bleeding. And it won't be long. I've got to find that meaning. That I've searched for so long. Set a-free all. Relying on their will to make me all that I am. And all that I'll be. Set a-free all. Will fall between the cracks with memories of all that I am. And all that I'll be. On broken wings I'm falling. And it won't be long. The skin on me is burning. By the fires of the sun. On skinned knees I'm bleeding. And it won't be long. I've got to find that meaning. That I've searched for so long

2121,"I used to wake up in the morning. I used to feel so bad. I got so sick of having sleepless nights. I went and told my dad. He said ""Son now here's some little something"". And stuck them on my wall. And now my nights ain't quite so lonely. In fact I I don't feel bad at all. Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful. Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night. Pitcures of Lily solved my childhood problems. Pictures of Lily helped me feel alright. Pictures of Lily. Lily oh Lily. Lily oh Lily. Pictures of Lily. And then one day things weren't quite so fine. I fell in love with Lily. I asked my dad where Lily I could find. He said ""Son now don't be silly"". ""She's been dead since 1929"". Oh how I cried that night. If only I'd been born in Lily's time. It would have been alright. Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful. Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night. For me and Lily are together in my dreams. And I ask you ""Hey mister have you ever seen"". ""Pictures of Lily?""."

Born in Bethlehem.. Children go where I send thee. How shall I send thee?. I'm gonna send thee two by two. Two for Paul and Silas. One for the little bitty baybe. That was born born. Born in Bethlehem.. Three for the Hebrew children.... Four for the four that stood at the door.... Five for the gospel preachers.... Six for the six that never got fixed.... Seven for the seven that never got to heaven.... Eight for the eight that stood at the gate.... Nine for the nine all dressed so fine.... Ten for the ten commandments.... Eleven for the eleven deriders...."
2130,I used to sit in a big apple tree. Welcome the sun as he shone down on me. Watch the fruit ripen smell the land grow. Felt the fall rains get colder and turn into snow.. And in the summer I'd walk through the trees. Roll up my trousers way over my knees. Waded a stream 'til rocks hurt my feet. The water was cool and the summer was sweet.. Autumn got lonely when harvest came 'round. Green leaves turned golden and fell to the ground. Clear nights got colder stars bright above. And in the winter I first fell in love.. She loved me truly 'til winter passed by. Left without warning and never said why. Maybe she's lonely needs me somewhere. Maybe by summer I won't even care.
2131,Open my eyes first thing I see. Your love smile smiling at me. Kiss my forehead up out of bed. Off to start your day here in bed I stay. Thinking bout last night be playing in my mind. When you touch me there. Ooh ooh it feels so right. Then interscinds. What am I doin. Get up out of bed. To myself thinkin. This can't be good This can't be good This can't be good. This can't be good This can't be good This can't be good. What's goin on what's happening to me. Promised myself I would never let this be. Never again never that way. Cut me so deep that I havent' been the same. What I feel right now I felt before. When I hear your name. And my fellins are floored. I'll fight it if I can. But I don't know if I should. The one thing I know. This can't be good babe. Oh I think I'm falling in love again. Told myself I never would. Ii think I'm falling in love again. This can not be good.
2132,See your face - you've got no-one to love you back. You better better win this place - you know it's the promised land. Don't let it hold you. Don't let it. You better. You bet it. It's gonna hold you. You bet it's gonna take control. That tears your soul. Trust - that'll make you self believe. To be a self made man. Turn that stuff - that defines your role to be ooh. To be a self made man. Get a heavy job - don't let them moguls waste your time (she's going down the line). To be a self made man. (Some undecipherable lyrics). Do you wanna be my honey?. Do you wanna be my girl?. Do you have the time to meet me?. Do you wanna be my honey?. Do you wanna be my girl?. Do you have the time to meet me?. Yeah. Self made self made man. Ooh girl gotta make yourself believe. Gotta turn that stuff see your face know I'm a made man. In this place known promised land. Self made man. Self. Be a self made man. Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do be a self made man. Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do be a self made man. Self made man. Self made man...
2133,"In the backseat of the taxi. When you told me we were only. Two punch drunk souls all tangled in the wind. And in the backseat. When you asked me: Is the sadness everlasting?. I pulled you closer looked at you and said: Love I think it is. And it creeps on in. To the corners of yourself. Yeah it creeps on in. Until it hurts like hell. And you know I never knew. How much I was getting into. No I never knew how much I was getting into. In the backseat of the taxi. When you told me we were only. Two punch drunk souls all tangled in the wind. And in the backseat. When you asked me: Is the sadness everlasting?. I pulled you closer looked at you and said. Love I think it is. I can't say that I can make you feel. Complete or free from your worry. But believe me when I tell you. ""Babe you'll never be lonely"". You'll never be lonely. You'll never be lonely. Don't you understand?. You won't be alone again. And it creeps on in. To the corners of yourself. Yeah it creeps on in. To the flawless parts as well. And you know I never knew. How much I was getting into. No I never knew just what I was getting into. In the backseat of the taxi. When you told me we were only. Two punch drunk souls all tangled in the wind. And in the backseat. When you asked me: Is the sadness everlasting?. I pulled you closer looked at you and said: Love I think it is. I can't say that I can make you feel complete. Or free from your worry. But believe me when I tell you. Babe you'll never be lonely. You'll never be lonely. You'll never be lonely. Don't you understand?. You won't be alone again"

2139,No war no greed. That would be something to see. I hope I live that long. No blood in the streets. Just a distant memory. The history books recount. Now were all free. Now were all free. No war no greed. That would be something to see. I hope I live that long. No want no need. The struggle to end poverty. Finally has been won. Now were all free. Now were all free. No war no greed. That would be something to see. I hope I live that long. Hold my constitution. And have the courage of heart and mind. To right what is wrong. Now were all free. Now were all free. But now you can't believe. What you're told. You can't believe what you hear. The speeches of the politicians. Ring untrue and insincere. You can't believe what you read. You can't believe what's said. They count the targets and the bombs. But do not count the dead. They do not count the dead. No war no greed. That would be something to see. I hope I live that long. Not lose my faith. In every word on the page. In the face of freedom. No war no greed. No war no greed. No war no greed

2141,Two weeks away it feels like the whole world should've changed. But I'm home now. And things still look the same. I think I'll leave it till tomorrow to unpack. Try to forget for one more night. That I'm back in my flat on the road. Where the cars never stop going through the night. To a life where I can't watch the sun set. I don't have time. I don't have time. I've still got sand in my shoes. And I can't shake the thought of you. I should get on forget you. But why would I want to?. I know we said goodbye. Anything else would've been confused but. I wanna see you again. Tomorrow's back to work and down to sanity. Should run a bath and then clear up the mess I made before I left here. Try to remind myself that I was happy here. Before I knew that I could get on a plane and fly away. From the road where the cars never stop going through the night. To a life where I can watch the sun set. And take my time. Take all our time. I've still got sand in my shoes. And I can't shake the thought of you. I should get on forget you. But why would I want to?. I know we said goodbye. Anything else would've been confused but. I wanna see you again. I wanna see you again. I wanna see you again. Two weeks away. All it takes to change and turn me around I've fallen. I walked away and never said that I wanted to see you again. I've still got sand in my shoes. And I can't shake the thought of you. I should get on forget you. But why would I want to?. I know we said goodbye. Anything else would've been confused but. I wanna see you again. (I wanna see you again). I've still got sand in my shoes. And I can't shake the thought of you. (I wanna see you again). I should get on forget you. But why would I want to?. I know we said goodbye. Anything else would've been confused but. I wanna see you again. I wanna see you again. I wanna see you again
2142,You say you're going through changes. Every day it seems your life is up and down. And you say that you're looking for an answer. Everywhere you look it seems. You can't be found. Like searching trying to find the rainbow. No ones ever found it yet it's told to be. But if you're looking for a lover. Everything you need you can find. right here with me. I've got the Midas Touch. Everything I touch turns to gold oh sugar. I've got the Midas Touch. Baby let me touch your body and your soul. I've got the Midas Touch. Everything I touch turns to gold oh sugar. I've got the Midas Touch. Baby let me touch your body and your soul. Now you've been trapped by love. Someone takes your heart and then says goodbye. So you say that you'll never love another. Tired of playing games and that's the reason why. But now whenever were together. There's a certain feeling that we both agree. And it's time that you've opened up to love. 'Cause if you don't ever try. then baby you may never see. I've got the Midas Touch. Everything I touch turns to gold oh sugar. I've got the Midas Touch. Baby let me touch your body and your soul. I've got the Midas Touch. Everything I touch turns to gold oh sugar. I've got the Midas Touch. Baby let me touch your body and your soul. Together you and I were meant to be. I'll be right beside whenever you need me. This love we have will never fade away. You can count on me 'cause I'm here to stay. I've got the Midas Touch. Everything I touch turns to gold oh sugar. I've got the Midas Touch. Baby let me touch your body and your soul. I've got the Midas Touch. Everything I touch turns to gold oh sugar. I've got the Midas Touch. Baby let me touch your body and your soul

I love the way you smile. Do you have any idea what seeing you does to me. I'm not livin' any kind of life I'm livin' in a fantasy. I wonder what it would be like. If we turned out the light. I wonder what it would be like. I'm longing for ya want to adore ya. Who would be the first to strike. If you stayed the night. I wonder what it would be like to love you. Well don't you think its strange. Fate brought you to my side. I was doing crunches. You were on stationary bike. I had given up on love I'd met too many freaks. Ever since I was seventeen I've been on this loosing streak. I wonder what it would be like. If we turned out the light. I wonder what it would be like. I'm longing for ya want to adore ya. Who would be the first to strike. If you stayed the night. I wonder what it would be like to love you. You can look at someone and use your imagination.

I'm going to paint the town on my days off. Cold slate roofs that glisten in starlight. Me and you singing a carol. On the tough side of town. For the poor folk in the old mission house. If it feels like we are floating in time. Give yourself up to the desert and the night. Eastern caravans are following lights. Strangeness reigns. There's Love in Heaven tonight. I'll be over sometime this christmas. If you behave yourself and don't drink too much. I'll come and feed the fire in your kitchen. See your tree and the view of the city all covered in snow. Leave the boy behind you won't miss him. Take a break from your phony kissing. There's no mistletoe in my kitchen. Just a tree and a view of the city covered in snow. If it feels like we are floating in air. Then the hour has passed it must be Christmas day. People shake your hand and wish you the best. Troubles leave you wonder why you were sad. I'm glad you came it must be Christmas day
2153,Your memory comes back to me. to starngle me with its sweet taste. see God would never be so cruel. to make me like without your face. Now that I have made you crawl. it does you good to see me fall. like poison apples from the tree. as heavy as a honey bee. (chorus). Hallelujah. I gave you away so easily. it makes me wounder why. Moving throught you every night. the lovely girls in dresses tight. The angels dancing on a pin. the people we are downing in. Like a needle going in. Oh I recall the moment when. you ruined me for other men. (chorus). Hallelujah. I gave you away so easily. it makes me wonder why. I don't know why. (repeat). If I die before you do.. believe me I'll be haunting you. I'll come upon you while you sleep. to drown you in a kiss. so deep.
2155,Blackbird singing in the dead of night. Take these broken wings and learn to fly.. All your life. You were only waiting for the moment to arise.. Blackbird singing in the dead of night. Take these sunken eyes and learn to see.. All your life. You were only waiting for the moment to be free.. Black bird fly black bird fly. Into the light of the dark black night.. Black bird fly black bird fly. Into the light of the dark black night.. Blackbird singing in the dead of night. Take these broken wings and learn to fly.. All your life. You were only waiting for this moment to arise. You were only waiting for this moment to arise. You were only waiting for this moment to arise
2157,Far Far Away Noddy Holder & Dave Lea. I've seen the yellow lights go down the Mississippi. I've seen the bridges of the world and they are for real/. I've had a red light off-the-wrist without me even getting kissed. It still seems so unreal. I've seen the morning in the mountains of Alaska. I've seen the sunset in the East and in the West /. I've sang the glory that was Rome And passed the 'Hound Dog' singer's home. It still seems for the best. And I'm far far a-way. With my head up in the clouds. And I'm far far a-way. With my feet down in the crowds. Letting loose around the world. But the call of home is loud. Still as loud. I've seen the Paris lights from high upon Montmartre. And felt the silence hanging low in No Man's Land/ /. And though those Spanish nights were fine It wasn't only from the wine. It still seems all in hand. And I'm far far away &c.... I've seen the yellow lights go down the Mississippi. The Grand Bahama Island stories carry on. And though those aligator smiles Stay in your memory for a while. There still seems more to come. And I'm far far away &c....

2167,"Got a bank vault in heaven got my name on the door. Every day I get richer add a little bit more. Come you tellers and lenders and lend me some more. Got a bank vault in heaven and it's mine for evermore. And the angels sing ""Fly fly fly"". The angels sing ""Fly fly fly"". Fly from the darkness that covers you all. Fly to the sky where the only wall is infinity infinity. Going to shine down from heaven right into your room. Take the minds of your children right off to the moon. Every mud hut and igloo every penthouse and farm. I'll shine down from heaven and I'll do my snake-charm. And the angels say ""Sing sing sing"" ""Sing sing sing"". Oh the whole world is singing the same happy tune. Something so low even hound dogs can croon to insanity insanity. Oh there's a signpost in heaven in the firmament blue. You can run to the wastelands but it points straight at you. I've got a bank vault in heaven what joy will it bring. All you Punchs and Judys I'll be pulling your strings"
2168,(Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe). . (chorus). Scratch the scandals in the twilight. Trying to shock but instead. Idle hands all orient to her. Pass a magic pillow under head. It's so much more attractive inside the moral kiosk. Inside cold dark fire twilight. Inside cold dark fire twilight. They scratch the scandals in the twilight. She was laughing like a Horae. Put that knee in dour landslide. Take this step to dash a roving eye. It's so much more attractive inside the moral kiosk. Inside cold dark fire twilight. Inside cold dark fire twilight. (repeat chorus). Inside cold dark fire twilight. Inside cold dark fire twilight.
2170,That gorilla you're dancing with. May not have too long to live. He's putting his hands in the wrong places. Time to rearrange his face. He's gonna dance with me instead. And I'm gonna tap dance on his head. Don't tempt me don't tempt me don't tempt me. I'm half way out of my seat. He's got the looks he's got the lolly. Driving me clean off my trolley. Doing the jitterbug doing the jive. Doing the shimmy snakes alive. That's not a dance that's S-E-X. Ban that couple certificate X. Don't tempt me don't tempt me don't tempt me. I'm half way out of my seat. Oh I'm a patient man but it's out of hand. If there's one thing that I can't stand. Get your mittens off my gal. Or you'll end up as mincemeat pal. I've got friends mean sons. They've got knives chains guns. Gas grenades knuckle-dusters. Lazy Susans blockbusters. Don't tempt me don't tempt me don't tempt me. I'm half way out of my seat. I'm sitting here calm as I can. While you polish the floor with another man. I'm not mad I'm a cuddly toy. Just keep me away from laughing boy. You say he's a relative some hope. If he's your uncle I'm the Pope!. Don't tempt me don't tempt me don't tempt me. I'm half way out of my seat
2172,"My Papa told me to stay out of trouble. ""When you've found your man make sure he's for real!"". I've learned that nothing really lasts forever. I sleep with the scars I wear that won't heal. they won't heal. Cos every time I seem to fall in love. Crash! Boom! Bang!. I find the heart but then I hit the wall. Crash! Boom! Bang!. That's the call that's the game. and the pain stays the same. I'm walking down this empty road to nowhere. I pass by the houses and blocks I once knew. My Mama told me not to mess with sorrow. but I always did and Lord I still do. I'm still breaking the rules. I kick it up. I kick it down. Cos every time I seem to fall in love. Crash! Boom! Bang!. I find the heart but then I hit the wall. Crash! Boom! Bang!. that's my real middle-name. it has always been the same. that's the call that's the game. and the pain stays the same.. I still feel the heat. slowly fallin' from the sky. and the taste of the kissing. shattered by rain. comin' tumblin' from behind. and the wild holy war. I kick it up. I kick it down. Cos every time I seem to fall in love. Crash! Boom! Bang!. I find the roses dying on the floor. Crash! Boom! Bang!. that's the call that's the game. and the pain stays the same. that's my real middle-name. it has always been the same. Oh Yea Oh Yea Oh Yea Uh-huh. been the same been the same. it has always been the same"

Keepin' your balance by a single thread .... Keepin' your heart strings tight and pure. All you can muster and nothing more and nothing more.

It can fill your cup with regret. Say a prayer for all the souls in bloom .... Say a prayer... Say a prayer ....

2190,Am I right or am I wrong?. Do I have to leave or do I belong - here?. I always thought the things I do are strong. I'm sorry for that all I got is this song - here!. Got nothing to lose lost all my faith in it. If that's the way it is I think I don't fit. All the fire inside my chest was heading at the wrong address. I wasted years I wasted tears. But all I had was loneliness. There's no more blue inside of me. I know what's worth it and what's not. I won't throw my best in front of thieves. 'Cause pain is what I got. I quit - with everything. I never wanted to be part of me. I quit - they're tryin' to press my heart down. Closer to the ground now. I quit - with everything. I never wanted to be controlling me. I quit - and it feels so bad inside. That rock 'n roll's dead!. Does anybody out there hear my cry?. Does anybody out there care if I die inside? (cause I die). Something has left the house I see!. And something came in. That makes me leave tonight!. Yes Charlie Brown has finally left the field. But I'm sure that he's still never giving yield!. (He fights his own fight). Raw people they rule the world. There's no sense for the silent world. Their symphony sounds oh so bad. And everyone joins in to that. You're right I'm down oh I feel down. But I don't think I've lost like you. 'Cause everything that I once had I still have. Yes I do!. I quit - with everything. I never wanted to be part of me. I quit - they're tryin' to press my heart down. Closer to the ground now. I quit - with everything. I never wanted to be controlling me. I quit - and it feels so bad inside. That rock 'n roll's dead!. Rock 'n' roll's dead...
2191,It felt like somebody had just walked in the room. I turned round it was stunning I diverted my eyes too soon. She had legs up to her shoulders and hair all down her back. But between her ears there was a lack of intrinsic facts. By this time I'm too far gone to abuse or use someone I should've said no...to the enemy below. I thanked God that we were leaving as I couldn't drink no more but I could dream of what I liked. Face down on the floor it was the way she moved her fingers that brought me back again. So it looked like we'd be up all night breaking out the chains. By this time we're to far gone.... The enemy below
2193,Daylight is breaking again. I hide in the dark. I'm watching the rain. You're out of touch. You're out of reach. What can I say I never wanted it this way. Love sleeps all alone. The cold telephone I know the heart. Yes I know the kind. The kisses of fire turning to grey. I never wanted it this way. I always wanted you to stay / Wash my pain away cause I'm half a woman half a shadow / Love always change with the trees the spring and the leaves the waves on the sea. Wilder than light the wind in your eyes led me astray. I never wanted it this way. I always wanted you to stay. Oh I need you yes I need you. Give me a reason to believe..
2194,A thought burst in my head and I need to tell you. It's news that I for thought. Was it a dream that happened long ago?. I think that I just forgot. Well it hasn't been the first time. And it sure does drive me mad. There's a boy who fogs his world. and now he's getting lazy. There's no motivation. and frustration makes him crazy. He makes a plan to take a stand. but always ends up sitting.. Someone help him up. or he's gonna end up quitting. I shuffle through my mind. To see if I can find. The words I left behind. Was it just a dream. that happened long ago?. Oh well.... Never mind.

Make me feel like crying tears I don't deserve. Please bleed. So I know that you are real. So I know that you can feel. The damage that you've done. Who have I become. To myself I am numb I am numb I am numb. Is this really living? Sometimes it's hard to tell. Or is this just a kinder gentler hell?. Turn out the lights. And let me stare into your soul. I was born and bled for you to hold. Please bleed. So I know that you are real. So I know that you can feel. The damage that you've done. Who have I become. To myself I am numb I am numb I am numb. Never said thank you. Never said please. Never gave reason to believe. So as it stands. I remain on my knees. Good lovers make great enemies. Please bleed. So I know that you are real. So I know that you can feel. The damage that you've done. Who have I become. To myself I am numb I am numb I am numb
2206,I saw you walking away from the battlefield. Through the clearing smoke to the other side. Lay down your weary head. And gazing up two ocean birds are wheeling turning. Paekakariki Beach on the other side. By the green of the hills and the rolling tide. I lay down in the ashen sand. And high above the ocean birds. were wheeling turning circling flying. And you have seen too much. Too many causes lost and won. The wild desires all drowned in the seven seas. And so we walk away from the battlefield. Through the clearing smoke to the other side. Lay down in the morning sun. and high above the ocean birds are.

You burn brightly in spite of yourself. I bring the water down to you. But you're too hot to touch. You're too hot to touch. Love somebody. Save their soul. Tie them to your heaven. Erase their hell. Save their lifestyle if you feel it. Don't try to change them. You never will. Sunflowers and your face fascinate me. You go into the dusty pink day. I come calling unto you. But you run.

2216,I wouldn't have compromised as much.. So much of myself for fear of having you hating me.. I would've sung so loudly. It would've cracked myself.. I became so self-conscious of anything exuberant.. I wouldn't have sold myself short.. I wouldn't have kept my eyes glued to the ground.. If I had've known my invisibility would not make a difference. I would've run around screaming proudly at the top of my voice.. I wouldn't have said it was in fact luck. I'm talking idealism here.. I would not have been so self-deprecating. I wouldn't have cowered for fear of having my eyes scratched out.. I wouldn't have cut my comfort off.. I wouldn't have feigned needlessness.. I would not have discredited every one of their compliments.. It was your approval I wanted.. Your congratulations..

Someday I'm gonna find it. Wish I knew what I was looking for. Inside the disarray (inside the disarray). I woke up this morning. Don't know where I'm going. But it's alright.

2231,If I listened long enough to you. I'd find a way to believe that it's all true. Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried.. Still I look to find a reason to believe.. Someone like you makes it hard to live. Without somebody else.. Someone like you makes it easy to give. Never thinking of myself.. If I gave you time to change my mind. I'd find a way to leave the past behind. Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried.. Still I look to find a reason to believe.. Someone like you makes it hard to live. Without somebody else.. Someone like you makes it easy to give. Never thinking of myself.. If I gave you time to change my mind. I'd find a way to leave the past behind. Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried..
2233,Somebody's screaming. looking at the ceilling. everything's so funny. I don't have the money. people don't even know me. but they know how to show me. Why can't you be nicer to me?. My pride is dying. I think I'm all done lying. nobody's sharing. so I stop caring. all alone and walking. nobody's talking. Why can't you be nicer to me?. Well the wind is blowing. where am I going. off a bridge and falling. nobody's calling. on the ground and laying. nobody's praying. Why can't you be nicer to me?.
2234,I went up to the mountain. Because you asked me to. Up over the clouds. To where the sky was blue. I could see all around me. Everywhere. I could see all around me. Everywhere. Sometimes I feel like. I've never been nothing but tired. And I'll be walking. Till the day I expire. Sometimes I lay down. No more can I do. But then I go on again. Because you ask me to. Some days I look down. Afraid I will fall. And though the sun shines. I see nothing at all. Then I hear your sweet voice oh. Oh come and then go come and then go. Telling me softly. You love me so
2235,Take the line between us and hold it close to you I want us to get together like lovers do. Let me kiss away your troubles the cold and lonely nights just take this heart I'm giving and love is on the rise / Like lovers do - want to hold you thru the night like lovers do - and when I look into your eyes like lovers do - oh I'm drowning in an ocean of emotion / It feels just like forever - like forever - since I made love to you September days of scarlet - be together - April morning dew. So take the love between us and hold it close to you I want us to get together like lovers do / Like lovers do.... .
2236,Miss Third Wards your first question. What is your aspiration in life?. Oh My aspiration in life. Would be to be happy. Mama said you're a pretty girl. What's in your head it doesn't matter. Brush your hair fix your teeth. What you wear is all that matters. Just another stage. Pageant the pain away. This time I'm gonna take the crown. Without falling down down. Pretty hurts. We shine the light on whatever's worse. Perfection is the disease of a nation. Pretty hurts. We shine the light on whatever's worse. Tryna fix something. But you can't fix what you can't see. It's the soul that needs the surgery. Blonder hair flat chest. Tv says bigger is better. South Beach sugar free. Vogue says. Thinner is better. Just another stage. Pageant the pain away. This time I'm gonna take the crown. Without falling down down. Pretty hurts. We shine the light on whatever's worse. Perfection is the disease of a nation. Pretty hurts. We shine the light on whatever's worse. Tryna fix something. But you can't fix what you can't see. It's the soul that needs the surgery. Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away. The pain's inside. And nobody frees you from your body. It's the soul that needs surgery. It's my soul that needs surgery. Plastic smiles and denial. Can only take you so far. And you break. When the paper sign leaves you in the dark. You left a shattered mirror. And the shards of a beautiful girl. Pretty hurts. We shine the light on whatever's worse. Perfection is the disease of a nation. Pretty hurts. We shine the light on whatever's worse. Tryna fix something. But you can't fix what you can't see. It's the soul that needs the surgery. When you'r alone all by yourself. And you're lying in your bed. Reflection stares right into you. Are you happy with yourself?. It's just a way to masquerade. The illusion has been shed. Are you happy with yourself?. Are you happy with yourself?. Yes
2239,There is not a river wide. Not a mountain high. And neither sin nor evil. Could change how I feel inside. Could change how I feel inside. Not all the strength of the ocean. Not all the heat from the sun from the sun. Though others have tried I just can't deny. For me you are the one. For me you are the one. But true love is priceless. For true love we pay a price. But there's nothing can keep me from loving you. Not fire nor not ice. Not fire nor not ice. Like the hero or the champion. You are the best you're the best. Like religion or superstition. With you I am blessed. With you I am blessed. Now the river may grow wider. The mountains may reach past the sky. But wether or not you feel the same. My love shall never die. My love shall never die. But true love is give and take. True love is sacrifice. But there's nothing can keep me from loving you. Not fire nor not ice. Not fire nor not ice. Not fire nor not ice.
2241,Like all the boys before. Like all the boys boys boys. Like all the boys before. Like all the boys boys boys. You left your blood stain on the floor. You set your sights on him. You left a hand print on the door. Like all the boys before like all the boys before. (boys boys boys boys). This is our luck baby running out. Her clothes were never off. We still have hours to run about. To scale the map scale the map. To get us back on track. I've seen you in a fight you lost. I've seen you in a fight. We're under the sheets and you're killing me. In our house made of paper your words all over me. We're under the sheets and you're killing me. Like all the boys before. Like all the boys boys boys. Like all the boys before. Like all the boys boys boys. In here the world won't bring us down. Our plan is golden. Out there a lonely girl could drown. In here we're frozen. Where did the people go?. My hands are empty. You're not the answer I should know. Like all the boys before like all the boys before. (whoa whoa whoa whoa). We're under the sheets and you're killing me. In our house made of paper your words all over me. We're under the sheets and you're killing me. We're in a mess baby we're in a mess babe. Your more is less babe (oh oh). We're in a mess baby we're in a mess babe. Your more is less babe (oh oh!). We're under the sheets and you're killing me. In our house made of paper your words all over me. We're under the sheets and you're killing me. Like all the boys before like all the boys before. We're under the sheets and you're killing me. In our house made of paper your words all over me.

Killing me killing me killing me. Killing me killing me killing me
2243,I'm giving you my heart and my soul. I'm giving you more than you'll ever know. I'm giving you just about everything I can. Can't you see that I'm just only one man. I took you out to the picture show. Then I took you walkin' outdoors. I walked you up and down the block. And I warned you baby this has got to stop. This has got to stop you're way over the top. Pack my things and walk we can't even talk. This has got to stop I just had enough. I'm gonna call your bluff walk you one more lap. And I watched you watching me as I watched you walk away from me. And I went off to that far country. I took a plane out to that Newfoundland. And you said to me that you didn't understand. This has got to stop you're way over the top. I'm gonna pack my things and walk we don't even talk. This has got to stop baby I just had enough. I'm gonna call your bluff walk me one more lap. Well I came back home and I burnt our house down. I watched it crumble to the ground. Oh it caved in like a piece of balsa wood. I turned to you and said baby this is just no good. And I worked and I tried to build it all back up again. Today you told me that you had really changed. Then you knocked down all my castles in the sand. Then I said baby I know now just where we stand. This has got to stop you're way over the top. Pack my bags and walk we don't even talk. This has got to stop I've just had enough. I'm gonna call your bluff this has got to stop. This has got to stop. Stop stop I've had enough. I'm gonna call your bluff. Stop stop stop. This has got to stop
2244,We were circus lights and cannonballs. We were way too high to ever fall. We were fireflies and shooting stars. We were burning up from the start. And we'd say are we gonna live forever?. I love you to my dying death. But sometimes hearts get swept up. In the waves. Remember when the night turned up. And sun went down. If just for a moment. We were falling at the speed of sound. Yeah the moon played a part. Two shadows in the dark. Beating with a teenage heart. Beating with a teenage heart. Would I ever recognise your face. If I saw you in a crowded place?. Would you hair still fall the way it did?. Would we laugh. And sing like when we were kids oh. Remember when the night turned up. And sun went down. If just for a moment. We were falling at the speed of sound. Yeah the moon played a part. Two shadows in the dark. Beating with a teenage heart. Beating with a teenage heart. Yeah we thought that we would last forever. Thought our love would never fade. Had your hand pressed on the window. As you pulled away. Remember when the night turned up. And sun went down. If just for a moment. We were falling at the speed of sound. Yeah the moon played a part. Two shadows in the dark. Beating with a teenage heart. Beating with a teenage heart. A teenage heart. Ooh yeah beating with a teenage heart
2245,We're boarding the night train. We're bored of sunlight. We want moon rays and nitrate. We want silver and fire. Cause every day that we spend overthinking. Makes me wanna spend the night overdrinking. If insane's the new sane. Then you're lost and gone wild. If the cops are all coming. We're staying not running. We'll be raging like crazy.

2250,The man who stole the water will swim forevermore. But he'll never reach the land on that golden shore. That faint white light will haunt his heart. Till he's only a memory lost in the dark. Dig a hole in the ground straight down to hell. Till there ain't no more water in the well well well. When you're down on your knees with nothing left to sell. Try diggin a little deeper in the well well well. Well well well. Well well well. Take care of your body like you care for your soul. Don't you dig yourself into a hole. Until you've paid the price you can't know what it's worth. The air and water the fire and earth. Dig a hole in the ground straight down to hell. Till there ain't no more water in the well well well. When you're down on your knees with nothing left to sell. Try diggin a little deeper in the well well well. Well well well. Well well well

And donated to the National Trust.. I need a fix cause I'm going down.. Down to the bits that I left uptown.. I need a fix cause I'm going down.. Mother Superior jump the gun. Mother Superior jump the gun. Mother Superior jump the gun. Mother Superior jump the gun.. Happiness is a warm gun. (bang bang shoot shoot). Happiness is a warm gun. When I hold you in my arms. And I feel my finger on your trigger. I know nobody can do me no harm. Because happiness is a warm gun.. Yes it is.
2256,So searching down and out looking for a place to stay. A place of no commitment a place with no involvement.. I got one eye on insanity the other on the wheel. One's turning one's burning blazing away.. One's turning one's burning blazing away.. Strange-looking exile with a passion for the dangerous. An eye for the wicked a tongue for the nasty.. I got one eye on insanity the other on the wheel. One's turning one's burning blazing away.. One's turning one's burning blazing away.. What is the reason that things change ?. What is the reason they can never stay the same ?. What can I do what can I do ?. Feel it release it things change.. Feel it release it things change.. Feel it release it things change.. What is the reason that things change ?. What is the reason they can never stay the same ?. What can I do what can I do ?. Feel it release it things change.. Feel it release it things change.. Feel it release it things change.. So searching down and out looking for a place to stay. A place of no commitment a place with no involvement.. I got one eye on insanity the other on the wheel. One's turning one's burning blazing away..

2296,By Warren Zevon. c. 1995 Zevon Music BMI. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. Hoist the mainsail - here I come. Ain't no room on board for the insincere. You're my witness. I'm your mutineer. I was born to rock the boat. Some may sink but we will float. Grab your coat - let's get out of here. You're my witness. I'm your mutineer. Long ago we laughed at shadows. Lightning flashed and thunder followed us. It could never find us here. You're my witness. I'm your mutineer. Long ago we laughed at shadows. Lightning flashed and thunder followed us.

2297,I WAS COMMITTED TO LIFE AND THEN COMMUTED TO THE OUTSKIRTS. With all the love in the world. Living for thirty minutes at a time with a break in the middle for adverts. But it's a wonderful world within these cinema walls. WHERE A SHOWER OF AFFECTION BECOMES NIAGARA FALLS. And you wish she could step down from the screen to your seat in the stalls. BUT IF STARS ARE ONLY PAINTED ON THE CEILING ABOVE. Then who can you turn to and who do you love. I want to get out while I still can. I want to be like Harry Houdini. Now I'm the invisible man. My head is spinning round faster and faster. Here I stand on the edge of disaster. I'm shattered like a piece of crystal porcelain or alabaster. Crowds surround loudspeakers hanging from the lampposts. Listening to the murder mystery. Meanwhile someone's hiding in the classroom. Forging books of history. NEVER MIND THERE'S A GOOD FILM SHOWING TONIGHT. WHERE THEY HANG EVERYONE EVERYBODY WHO CAN READ AND WRITE.
2298,Fire me in an oven. Until I go hard enough. To deal with losing you. I'm tired of thinking of you. Each and every minute I see. Something I know you'd love. We're all made of glass. All made of glass. Cheating ourselves to believe. We'll be last. Like a fool I thought it was true. I was holding your flowers. If only you knew. A diary fills it's pages. With one eye on the clock. How long how long. Have we got. Until we're everything we ought to be. Terrified while the picture of dignity. Come eat with me at the table of this life. (whistles). All made of glass. All made of glass. Yes we're all made of glass. All made of glass. Cheating ourselves to believe. We'll be last. Like a fool I thought it was true. I was holding your flowers. If only you knew. If only you knew
2299,I'm alive. I feel your heartbeat. Moon in your mouth. We are perfection. Life and desire. I wanna stay here now. Every moment is a luxury. Just hold me now. And don't let go. You started something. I'm alive. I feel the blood. See stars in your eyes. Every cell in this shell. Lights a light. So hold me now. And don't let go. We started something. We're alive. We're looking at the moon. It's the same face we all see
2301,"Walking through the cross fire heart. Feeling heavy and hopeless. Wonderin' how I ever. Will see through this darkness.. Every drop of blood can be so beautiful. And I sure was bleedin' the drops by the bucketful.. I have the strength to endure and all the love so pure.. I have the strength to endure because... because.... I'm not afraid to tell her just how things work.. Ride a hurricane through the fast lane.. Always looking over my shoulder.. She said ""There's something about you. And neon lights always glow hot.. Baby we can see this through just give me. All the strength you've got."". I have the strength to endure and all the love so pure.. I have the strength to endure because... because.... I'm not afraid to tell her just how things work.. Ride a hurricane through the fast lane.. Always looking over my shoulder.. She said ""There's something about you. And neon lights always glow hot.. Baby we can see this through just give me. All the strength you've got."". I have the strength to endure and all the love so pure.."
2303,I think it's perfectly clear. we're in the wrong band. Ginger is always sincere. just not to one man. she called me up and she said. you know that I'm drowning. it's the dog trainer again. he says that he thinks that she needs more hands. I think it's perfectly clear. we're in the wrong band. Senator let's be sincere. as much as we can. he called her up and he said. the new prosecutor soon will be wanting a word. so she's got a soft spot for heels and spurs. and there's something believin in her voice again. said there's something believin. instead of just leavin. And she gets her cigars from the sweet fat man. I think it's perfectly clear. we're in the wrong band. Heidi says she'll be sincere. as much as she can. I called her up and I said. you know that I'm drowning. put on your raincoat again. cause even the sun's got a price on it. and there's something believin in her voice again. said there's something believin. instead of just leavin. She said it's time I open my eyes. don't be afraid to open your eyes. maybe she's right. maybe she's right. maybe she's right. maybe she's right.
2304,H to the E to the X to the U to the M. I'm Hexum I always seem to vex them. Even when I really don't mean to. But I'm a brick house and you're a lean to. I kick the positivity like a shipwreck on a raft. In a sea of negativity it covers them half. Half of the world the figure is intact. Which way will you have an impact?. Come back to your bro do what your soul. But when you're in the mode just flow. I stick to the brick of the house of the funk. And the swing and the vibe of the reggae hip hop. Sing it for the people not the chaser of the steeple. And whatever you do don't stop. I come and drop a clue from me to you. Like Fantasy Island Chad's got one tattoo. If you need to understand Juan Bond is detective man. If you need to understand Juan Bond is detective man. J U A N B O N D. J U A N B O N D. J U A N B O N D. Check it out I've got clout. (No you don't). Yes I do. (No you don't). Yes I do. (No you don't). Yes I do. (No you don't). Yes I do. (No you don't). Yes I do. (No you don't). Yes I do. (No you don't). Yes I do. (No you don't). Damn. Miles I'm drivin' in the mach with mad. Not unlike a box I am endore how fox I am. Inferior spinning is my hand. I see a man like me stand. Between mirrors and seem myself go all in lieu of them. Flowing I didn't know my soul dig. Becomes the body of another one. Constellation the mirror is such a simple above collection. And the mic down in my eye. Today we're taking out Paris or say. Of the lands heavy spirit of ill descending. Oh my God I made a mess haul. See mercury fall from hands flung. Red super and deadly as I step into an outer sea. If you need to understand Juan Bond is detective man. If you need to understand Juan Bond is detective man. J U A N B O N D. J U A N B O N D. J U A N B O N D. Check it out I've got clout. (No you don't). Yes I do. (No you don't). Yes I do. (No you don't). Yes I do. (No you don't). Yes I do. (No you don't). Yes I do. (No you don't). Yes I do. (No you don't). Yes I do. (No you don't). Damn. Here's some advice it's called A B C. This is your world you can be anything. People look at me and think I know just what I am doing. But half of the fucking time I do not have a clue and. In any given situation I always say stupid things. Not as bad as P-Nut but he's cool just the same. Norwegian Scottish Irish and Mexican. And on the drums is the one Chad Sexton. Super phat beats that you just can't fuck with. Doing the type of shit gonna have a good run. With the stupid motherfuckers and those party going thieves. Living my life with them 311 University
2306,I feel so extraordinary. Something's got a hold on me. I get this feeling I'm in motion. A sudden sense of liberty. I don't care 'cause I'm not there. And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow. Again and again I've taken too much. Of the things that cost you too much. I used to think that the day would never come. I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun. My morning sun is the drug that brings me here. To the childhood I lost displaced by fear. I used to think that the day would never come. That my life would depend on the morning sun.... When I was a very small boy. Very small boys talked to me. Now that we've grown up together. They're afraid of what they see. That's the price that we all pay. Our valued destiny comes to nothing. I can't tell you where we're going. I guess there's just no way of knowing. I used to think that the day would never come. I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun. My morning sun is the drug that brings me here. To the childhood I lost displaced by fear. I used to think that the day would never come. That my life would depend on the morning sun.... Now I fear you've left me standing. In a world that's so demanding. I used to think that the day would never come. I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun. My morning sun is the drug that brings me near. To the childhood I lost replaced by fear. I used to think that the day would never come. I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun. My morning sun is the drug that brings me near. To the childhood I lost displaced by fear. I used to think that the day would never come. That my life would depend on the morning sun...
2307,I've been loving you a long time. Down all the years down all the days. And I've cried for all your troubles. Smiled at your funny little ways. We watched our friends grow up together. And we saw them as they fell. Some of them fell into Heaven. Some of them fell into Hell. I took shelter from a shower. And I stepped into your arms. On a rainy night in Soho. The wind was whistling all its charms. I sang you all my sorrows. You told me all your joys. Whatever happened to that old song. To all those little girls and boys. Now the song is nearly over. We may never find out what it means. But there's a light I hold before me. And you're the measure of my dreams. The measure of my dreams. Sometimes I wake up in the morning. The gingerlady by my bed. Covered in a cloak of silence. I hear you talking in my head. I'm not singing for the future. I'm not dreaming of the past. I'm not talking of the fist time. I never think about the last. Now the song is nearly over. We may never find out what it means. Still there's a light I hold before me. You're the measure of my dreams. The measure of my dreams. .
2308,This song started as a rant against haters. But that'd be giving in to the instigators. If there is one thing I'd like to pull off. When someone steps with hate all I do is just scoff. You can't burn me (2x). The same force that flows through every circuit. The juice that's spent everytime you work it. Every life form is based on this simplicity. The soul that you have is electricity. You can't avoid that. Evolution is fact. We're all from the same Lucy. Despite differences you see. I'm in disbelief at what people will believe. All along I thought we had our hearts on our shirtsleeve. If one thing I can say as a piece of advice. Don't believe it till you see it and then see it twice. It's so funny (2x). The same force that flows through every circuit. The juice that's spent everytime you work it. Every life form is based on this simplicity. The soul that you have is electricity. You can't avoid that. Evolution is fact. We're all from the same Lucy. Despite differences you see. A call out for unity. In every province and city. What do you think we've been saying. Since we first started playing.
2309,The smile you smile as you and I see through your laughing eyes. The smile you smile as you and I see through your laughing eyes.. O baby in the whirlpool of them. I can be in paradise.. I go roamin' in the gloamin ever and a day with you. O yes we will I go roamin' in the gloamin?ever and a day with you. O baby and sit between the stars and say. That's my point of view.. O yes - I I I I I love you. I I I I I love you.. In the purple heather on a hillside mountain fog will stray. O yeah in the purple heather on a hillside mountain fog will stray.. O yeah and chase the coloured the grass. Around us in the same old way.. I I I I I love you baby. I I I I I love you O baby..
2311,Hey kids shake it loose together. The spotlight's hitting something. That's been known to change the weather. We'll kill the fatted calf tonight. So stick around. You're gonna hear electric music. Solid Walls of sound. Say Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet. But they're so spaced out Bennie and the Jets. But they're weird an they're wonderful. Oh Beannie she's really keen. She's got electrice [eletric] boots a mohair suit. You know I read it in a magazine. Oh! Bennie and the Jets. Hey kids plug into the faithless. Maybe they're blinded. But Bennie makes them ageless. We shall survive let us take ourselves along. Where we fight our parents out in the streets. To find who's right and who's wrong
2312,I'll keep swinging for the fences. It's like this heart is defenseless. Against the passion that's pumpin' through my veins. Blood sweat tears it's a callin'. And if I can't walk then I'm crawlin'. It might flicker but they can't kill the flame. I can't stop. I can't quit. It's in my heart. It's on my lips. I can't stop no. I can't quit. It's in my heart yeah. I'm all in. Til the wheels fall off. Til the spotlight fades. I will lift your banner high. I will lift your banner high. And til the walls crash in. For the rest of my days. I'll lay it all on the line. Til the day I die. Til the day I die. Til the end of the line. Til the day I die. It's your name I'll glorify. It's runnin' deeper than the ocean. This ain't religion it's devotion. 365 Every minute everyday. So in the middle of the madness. They can stretch me out like canvas. But I ain't ever gonna fit in their frame. Til I die and they put me in the coffin. Don't matter if I'm on the road or if I'm recordin'. Tell me what you think about me. That really ain't important. You know Imma represent um. I ain't playin'. Can't afford to. I only got one life and I get it though. And this is not an act not a movie not a tv show. I don't know what quittin' means I don't ever take it slow. You know I'm on the grind me and toby in the studio. Do it for the king what you know about that?. Say you goin' harder mm I doubt that'. You say you doin' work. But you're asking where the couch at. How you doin' work when you asking where the couch at?. God is not a crutch you can use him when you wanna. You only look to heaven. When you goin' through some drama. And when they goin' through some problems. And that's the only time they call him. I guess I don't understand that life wonder why?. Cause' I'm all in. Til the day I die

2314,by Ginger Baker and Mike Taylor. When the city of Atlantis stood serene above the sea. Long time before our time when the world was free. Those were the days.. Golden cymbals flying on ocarina sounds. Before wild Medusa's serpents gave birth to hell. Disguised as heaven.. Those were the days yes they were those were the days.. Those were their ways miracles everywhere are they now?. They're gone.. Those were their ways yes they were those were their ways.. Those were the days yes they were those were the days.. Tie your painted shoes and dance blue daylight in your hair. Overhead a noiseless eagle fans a flame.. Wonder everywhere.. Chorus.
2315,Well there comes Lola out of control-a:. She just loves those rhythm and blues.. And miss Ivy will be arriving;. in leopard skin tights she's willing to cruise.. It's a fiend scene and it happens 'bout once a week.. So roam on in it ain't no sin to get low down in the street.. There's Jimmy and Jojo there's Kim and Keith. Way outside the eyes of cool..

2317,Hey Maria Papa said. You better go to bed. Maria Mama said. You better go to bed. And little sister said. You better go to bed. The older brother said. You heard what Papa said. You better say goodnight. You better shut the light. And Papa told you no. You can't go out tonight. But Papa didn't know. Maria had a date. And couldn't let him wait. So in a little while. She waited till the lights were low. She went out the window to her beau and so. There's a lot of huggin' then. A lot of kissin' then. A lot of huggin' him. A lot of kissin' him. A lot of happy talk. A lot of moon above. But very little time. But very little time. To make a lot of love. To make a lot of love. Which is a normal thing. To make a lot of love. For it was summertime. When all the crickets sing. And in the summertime. When anyone's in love. The crickets sing a happy song. But they didn't do their repetoire for long. Suddenly the Papa came. And then the Mama came.

2319,I fell down in the desert baby yeah. I had nothing but a peice of paper oh yeah. I had to write something down. And I found myself alone then I let go of everything. Into another dimension. Purple haze is in the sky. See the angels wicked eye. all these things we must try. 'Till we see the reasons why oh yeah. Lightning crash on the hill tonight(yeah). I got a feeling everything is gonna be alright. Then a horse came running to me. Said we're gonna go to the sanctuary. Then a storm began to blow. Into another dimension.. Purple haze is in the sky. See the angels wicked eye. all these things we must try. 'Till we see the reasons why oh yeah. I got lost in the desert baby. I found temples made out of paper. They were drummin' with golden bones. Buildin' dreams outside of their homes. Then I let go of everything. Into another dimension
2320,Listen to the children sing. Watch them dancing all 'round the Christmas tree .... Waiting for the opening. Early Christmas morning .... All around the world is sleeping. Little children there's no peeping. Wait and see what Santa's bringing. Early Christmas morning .... Icicles and breakfast cakes .... Friends and family we will celebrate. Sounds that joy and laughter make. Early Christmas morning .... All around and far off places. Angels waken smiling faces. Wrapping us with love and graces. Early Christmas morning ....

2323,CHEROKEE MIST (JIMI HENDRIX). The night I was born. Lord the moon turned a fire red. Said the night I was born. Lord the moon turn a fire red. My poor mother cried the gypsy was right. And she fell down ... right down dead. She took me past the outskirts of infinity. Well I... I made a love to you lil' girl when you'r sleepin. and you felt no pain. I did remember loved in your dream into that night. and I've seen your smile till stayin'. and I milion miles adventure the way from you that i'm on. Yet new picture of frame. My arrows are made of desires. From far away as jupiters sulphur mines. My arrows are made of desires. From far away as jupiters sulphur mines
2324,I was on the outside. When the world started spinning. You were busy throwing rocks. While I was getting stoned. In between a sunrise. There are things that don’t look pretty. Somehow I believe that I’ve got to carry on. Something about your love…gets to me. Something about your love….Killing me. Killing me. Spreading out our wings in vain. Filling up the spaces. Then we let go. Flying at the speed of sound. I could feel the crash. Couldn’t find the traces. All that we had. Lay in pieces on the ground. Something about your love…gets to me. Something about your love….Killing me. Killing me. All of the things we saw amazed our eyes. Let’s celebrate. The light I’ve been leaning on is where you’ve gone. You don’t need a reason. To let me down so easy. Just move away from my world and see. If you’re gonna go. And let me know you’re leaving. Anything we hold. Any day can break free. Something about your love…gets to me. Something about your love….Killing me. Killing me
2325,[Verse 1]. Just another caricature. See how temptation leads. It sells me the lies. like a sheep in disguise. With every word it plants another seed. [Verse 2]. I feel a change in the atmosphere. I never thought I'd end up back here. Divided alone afraid. In a breath my chains reappear. [Chorus]. And I build it all up. just to watch it fall down. (Nothing left to save I'm letting go). And I'm digging all up. What I've buried underground. I'm losing I'm losing control. I'm losing control. I'm losing control. [Verse 3]. Just another thorn in my side. I try again and fail. I seal my fate it's almost too late. I try to hold on. but it's slipping slipping away. [Chorus]. And I build it all up. just to watch it fall down. (Nothing left to save I'm letting go). And I'm digging all up. What I've buried underground. I'm losing I'm losing control. I'm losing control. I'm losing control. [Bridge]. Hold on to me don't let me fall. 'Cause I can't waste it all on nothing. Hold on to me please don't let go. I'm losing everything. [Chorus]. And I build it all up. just to watch it crash down. (I'm losing everything!). And I'm digging all up. what I buried underground. I'm losing I'm losing control. I'm losing control. I'm losing control. Control. Control. Control. Control
2326,I would lock you up. But I could not bear to hear you. Screaming to be set free. I would chain you up. If I'd thought you'd swear. The only one that mattered was me me me. I would strap you up. But don't worry baby. You know I wouldn't hurt you 'less you wanted me to. It's too late to stop. Won't the heavens save me?. My daddy said the devil looks a lot like you. You take me to the edge of heaven. Tell me that my soul's forgiven. Hide you baby's eyes and we can.... You take me to the edge of heaven. One last time might be forever. When the passion dies -. It's just a matter of time before my heart is. Looking for a home. I'm like a maniac at the end of the day. I'm like a doggie barking at your door. So come take me back to the place you stay. And maybe we can do it once more. You say I'm dangerous. But don't worry baby. I get excited at the things that you do. And there's a place for us in a dirty movie. 'Cos no-one does it better than me and you. You take me to the edge of heaven. Tell me that my soul's forgiven. Hide your baby's eyes and we can.... You take me to the edge of heaven. One last time might be forever. Please don't tell me lies. It's just a matter of time before my heart is. Looking for a home. I ain't got no more worries. I'm gonna spend some times with you. Loving you takes such courage. And don't you think that I know it. You take me to the edge of heaven. You tell me that my soul's forgiven. Hide your baby's eyes and we can....

2354,Watching the wildlife. On my way home the state of Rome. People gliding on the floor. Pleased with life not needing more. Sunset on the river. People go home in the rain. Familiar faces on the train. Running scared and staying sane. If you live by the sword. Well that's your own reward. So don't walk with me. Watching the wildlife. The beast within you. Eats your heart out. Get free from hate and get in love. Boys in the backyard. The girls are hanging out the lines. Washing the day wash your troubles away. It's game we have to play. Ghosts are chasing you round. Things that happen in the past. Don't make that mistake again. The sun beats down the streets of passion. If you live by the sword. Well that's your own reward. So don't talk with me. Watching the wildlife. The beast within you. Eats your heart out. Get free from hate and get in love. Your own worst enemy. Get free from hate and get in love. If you live by the sword. Watching the wildlife. Watching you. The beast within you too. Watching the wildlife. Get in love get in love. Watching the wildlife. We all live in a dream in home. We watch TV and drive a car. We go outside but not too far. Watching the wildlife. We walk the water like a sun. Living cuts you like a knife. Living here watching the Wildlife.

2363,"Bells are ringing soul of France. Bells are singing of romance. C'est tres jolie en Paris in the spring. Watching all the lovers walk along the Seine. Pitch a penny in her like a wishing well. Feed the pigeons in the park near Tour-Eifelle. Bells are ringing soul of France. Bells are singing of romance. There's a chapel ""Sacre Coure"" in quaint Montmarte. In the open air the painters show their art. In the restaurant sip a beaujolies. What a perfect way to spend a lovely day. Bells are ringing soul of France. Bells are singing of romance. Sunday morning hear the bells of Notre Dame. Watching belles jeunes filles and the handsome gendarmes. Near the Arc De Triomphe on the Champs-Elysees. Coffee and croissants in a sidewalk cafe. Some people go to see the races at Deauville. Or weekend by the racing tides of Mont San Michelle. Some take the tour of Chartres on an autobus. While the writers and the artists never leave Mont Parnasse."
2366,I lay on my back in the lake at night in the summer time trying to remember. Every last second every last breath that I spent with you. The yellow dotted line reflected in your eyes.

We’ve both felt love before even if we deny it. That familiar feeling of believing that we’ll die without it. Be we never do well not completely. Come on babe we both know that I’ll stay. The Virigin Mary lives beside the highway. Let’s go and see her lets ask her blessing today. Bless us. Bless us. Bless us

When the night comes. When no one knows. I can feel it. I've got my private radio. I'm finally out of my pillow. 'Cause I'm lyin' here but I am ready good to go. If I don't win I'll leave this town.

(I've got my private radio). There's a part of me no one will ever leave be. (My private radio). My private radio. My private radio
2370,Lights camera action. The first time I held her hand. The first time I kissed her lips. Hot dog pop corn I have a coke. All the magic of the big screen. All the sudden people start to scream. Everything everything is possible. Where all the dreams come true. Seems so real even the impossible. Where all the dreams come true. Scary dramatic fantastic. She gets so scared watching frankenstein. She holds me tight and it feels so fine. It's alive. Where all the dreams come true. Seems so real. Even the impossible. Where all the dreams come true. It's alive. Where all the dreams come true. Everything everything's possible. Where all the dreams come true. The end

Going where the lost ones go?. [Chorus:]. I will be with you. I'm losing the love I found. Crying without a sound. Where have you gone?. I will be with you. You were my fool for love.

2373,One Two Three Four. If you think you can well come on man. I was a Green Beret in Viet Nam. No more of your fairy stories. 'Cause I got my other worries.. 53rd and 3rd. Standing on the street. 53rd and 3rd. I'm tryin' to turn a trick. 53rd and 3rd. You're the one they never pick. 53rd and 3rd. Don't make you feel sick ?. If you think you can well come on man. I was a Green Beret in Viet Nam. No more of your fairy stories. 'Cause I got my other worries.. 53rd and 3rd. Standing on the street. 53rd and 3rd. I'm tryin' to turn a trick. 53rd and 3rd. You're the one they never pick. 53rd and 3rd. Don't make you feel sick ?. Then I took out my razor blade. Then I did what God forbade. Now the cops are after me.

2374,Anderson/Squire/Howe/White/Sherwood/Khoroshev. I speak from some sort of protection of learning. Even tho' I make it up as I go on. A special trait is that I've tried. To reach all feelings. So I speak a new language of love. Some say that it is written in the circle. Others that it is written in the sun. But I protect myself by seeing this experience. As a metaphor for moving on. Sometimes I check myself. To start to believe in. The horoscopes you read everyday. They're telling me somethings. I really ought to know. But then again I like to. Then again I learn to. Then again I'm running away. Vision is coming so fast I can't stop myself. Vision forgets who is real. On the city streets people get lost. Just waiting for history. Pushing the real world away. Taking a chance only once in your life. Only weakness can stop you from hearing. New languages. Translate each word. As they bring you creation. Your voice is the perfect key. Is there something that. I'm supposed to see. Is there something that I'm. Supposed to feel. I'm with you. And I can't help but want to know. (Talk to me). Is there something that I'm supposed to teach. (Speak to me). Is there something that I'm supposed to find. As I reach to the healing in each spoken word. For some strange reason time just cannot wait a minute. I'm chasing every second before I let go. Yesterday my history. Dreams are still a mystery. This living is a gift I should know. Lay it down and let me live the new language. Let me learn at every twist every turn. Lay it down and let me love the further future. Let me know I'm running. Let me know I'm learning. Let me know I'm moving on. Vision is racing so fast I can't stop myself. Chasing the reason. For all kinds of wondering. People embracing these feelings of limbo. Just waiting for some kind of truth. Taking a chance as it comes only once. Only strength can do justice. With words of new languages. Translate creation. To bring you salvation. Your voice is the perfect key. (Talk to me). Is there something that. I'm supposed to see. (Speak to me). Is there something that I'm. Supposed to feel. I'm with you. And I can't help but want to know. (New languages). (Talk to me). Is there something that. I'm supposed to teach. (Speak to me). Is there something that I'm supposed to find. As I reach to the healing of each spoken word (new languages).

And u can say ""Hey weve really come a long way"".. N u can say ""Hey it can only b this way"".. But you might b careful it really hurts when its real.. You might b careful it really hurts when its real.. You will go down down down....oh. Set the alarm clock baby. Dont u miss the sun?. Im feeling very warm hearted baby.

2376,When I hold the key to open heaven's door. I will never make the mistake and give it back. When I hold the key to open my mind before it's too late. I will never give it back. Bridge:. There's just one way I see. The way I think it's right for me. You say to me I will repent what I do. If it's right I'll stop before. When I see the light of sun will fade away. And I reveal what I have loved before. It's too late when I can't see the hours I pay. And I reveal what I have loved before. Bridge:. There's just one way I see. The way I think it's right for me. You say to me I will repent what I do. If it's right I'll stop before. Chorus:. The life I try to give is. All I have inside of me. It's one kind of life for me. This music you hear.

See his strong hands. But tomorrow they will tremble cold as ice. See the drunk man try to ask him why. He will laugh and tomorrow he will tell you another lie. There's a fight in his head he cannot win. Getting stronger makes him mad burning sin. You--you cannot hide. You--you cannot describe your feelings inside. (Solo: Mike/Kai). Chorus:. The life I try to give is. All I have inside of me. It's one kind of life for me. This music you hear. The strength we have inside is. So much more than you will know. But if you can't see the life around. You'll always walk alone

Like a time machine take you out to a different year. Phoebus Apollo played on his lyre. While we danced to the music of the sphere. And as the moon went down and the sun came up. With the mercury risin' too. 'Twas then the prophet said the secret of the dead. I'll whisper it to you. Livin' in another world. Livin' in another time. Like a comet I was hurled. Oh livin' in another world. Jupiter Hollow. In the midnight sun. Well no man of dreams was ever more outdone. Where the swallows circle over head. And muses gather by the river of the tears we shed. Just like a pioneer in the new frontier. I don't know where to begin. Because nobody cares when a man goes mad. And tries to free the ghost within. Livin' in another world. Livin' in another time. Like a comet I was hurled. Oh livin' in another world.

I want to go where lovers meet. I want to breathe the air they breathe. I want to touch the dreams they dream. When I find someone to love. I want to go where lovers meet.

I want to go where lovers meet.
2405,I believe what I was told. Listen to the stereo under the covers of my bed. The stories of the old days. The 6 wives of Henry. Origin into the center. Of the earth the place of my birth. Was the music that my brothers and my sister played to me. And how I believed the stories that they told me. 'Cause I'm a believer. I believe in the stories from the songs. From the old days. Believer. I believe in the world that they told me existed. On the vinyl and the tapes and from the Cd players. That came later so much later than the good old days. Down a yellow brick road. I drive a yellow taxi to a yellow submarine. Just for fun a super triple sign for me. A full [?] banquet or a night at the opera. For all it's worth the place of my birth. Was the music that my brothers and my sister played to me. And how I believed the stories that they told me. 'Cause I'm a believer. I believe in the stories from the songs. From the old days. Believer. I believe in the world that they told me existed. On the vinyl and the tapes and from the Cd players. That came later so much later than the good old days. Someone save my life every single night. When the words and music play. When the records took me away. Yeah someone save my life every single night. I just listen to the music. To the words in the music. To the words in the music. Listen to the words in the music. Friends and the music. Listen to the words and the music music. Music music music music. The pace of my breath. Why's the music that my brothers and my brother play to me. And how I believe. The stories that they told me. 'Cause I'm a believer. I believe in the stories from the songs. From the old days. Believer. I believe in the world that they told me existed. On the vinyl and the tapes and from the Cd players. That came later so much later than the good old days. I believe what I was told.

2406,Impossible desire impossible the dream. We lined them all up together and set off on the chase. Now the years they are gone like thieves in the dark. Did your eyes follow after them into the night?. I watched you as you tried and tried. To pull the sun from out of the sky. The colours all run and the clouds collide. But that was never enough. And me I've got a black place in my heart. My favourite chord my favourite card. That I draw every time on these occassions. If you leave a fire to burn it will burn itself away. It's a long way back through the dirty waters for you and me. And you're still haunted by the hands. All is letting you go. And if I told you not to look would you do that for me this one time?
2408,The flowers died on fields of hope. All the way from east to west. Where the mighty winds will blow. I? ll put my dreams to rest. This scary monster is very much alive. Like a hundred years ago. If all those missiles would be bread. No one had to starve tonight. We run for shelter and what is left. Is a life ain't worth a dime. So far away from human rights. Stranded all alone. It's a long way to go. To find the world we used to know. A long way to go. To find the better world we used to know. Before we make this world a mess. We gotta clean up our minds. We could be brothers sisters yes. United once and all the time. From out of space the captain takes a look. At mother earth so small. It's a long way to go. To find the world we used to know. A long way to go. To find the better world we used to know. Who will be cryin' when we fall. Just tell me. Who in the world can heal our souls. It's a long way to go. To find the world we used to know. A long way to go. To find the better world we used to know. A better world we used to know. A better world. It? s a long way to go
2409,Yellow diamonds in the light. Now we're standing side by side. As your shadow crosses mine. What it takes to come alive. It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny. But I've gotta let it go. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. Shine a light through an open door. Love and life I will divide. Turn away cause I love you more. Feel the heartbeat in my mind. It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny. But I've gotta let it go. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place
2411,"She said. ""I know what it's like to be dead.. I know what it is to be sad."". And she's making me feel like. I've never been born.. I said. ""Who put all those things in your head?. Things that make me feel that I'm mad. And you're making me feel like. I've never been born."". She said ""You don't understand what I've said."". I said ""No no no. You're wrong.. When I was a boy. Everything was right.. Everything was right."". I said. ""Even though you know what you know. I know that I'm ready to leave. Because you're making me feel like. I've never been born."". She said ""You don't understand what I've said."". I said ""No no no. You're wrong.. When I was a boy. Everything was right.. Everything was right."". I said. ""Even though you know what you know.

2412,No pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. No social ladder to climb around here. No panhandlers going to stake any claim here. Goldmine is not what it's worth know the score.

For a time we won't forget. Here's the hum of desperation. Heres the test tube mating call. Here's the latest carbon cycle. Here's the clergy of the mall. Here's the song of shear and torsion. Here's the bloodbath magazine. Here's the harvest of contusions. Here's the narcoleptic dream. Told my little Pollyanna. Here's a place where we can stay. We have come to see tomorrow. We have given up today. Down among the dancing quanta. Everything exists at once. Up above in Transverse City. Every weekend lasts for months. Here's the hum of desperation. Heres the test tube mating call. Here's the latest carbon cycle. Here's the clergy of the mall. Here's the witness and the victim. Here's the relatives' remains. Here's the well-known double helix.

But I know I want more than the starting line. So give me the fire. I can hear the motor running down the interstate. And all the distractions fade away. And if the house burns down tonight. I got everything I need with you by my side. I see the smoke piling up in the rear view mirror. Yeah but I ain't ever seen it any clearer. If the house burns down tonight. I got everything I need when I got you by my side. And let the rest burn. And let the rest burn. And let the rest burn. I've given too much of my heart away.

2482,Well I shuffled through the city on the 4th of July. I had a firecracker waiting to blow. Breakin' like a rocket who makin' its way. To the cities of Mexico. Lived in an apartment out on Avenue A. I had a tar-hut on the corner of 10th. Had myself a lover who was finer than gold. But I've broken up and busted up since. And love don't play any games with me. Anymore like she did before. The world won't wait so I better shake. That thing right out there through the door. Hell I still love you New York. Found myself a picture that would fit in the folds. Of my wallet and it stayed pretty good. Still amazed I didn't lose it on the roof of the place. When I was drunk and I was thinking of you. Every day the children they were singing their tune. Out on the streets and you could hear from inside. Used to take the subway up to Houston and 3rd. I would wait for you and I'd try to hide. And love won't play any games with you. Anymore if you don't want 'em to. The world won't wait and I watched you shake. But honey I don't blame you. Hell I still love you New York. Hell I still love you New York. New York. I remember Christmas in the blistering cold. In a church on the upper west side. Babe I stood their singing I was holding your arm. You were holding my trust like a child. Found a lot of trouble out on Avenue B. But I tried to keep the overhead low. Farewell to the city and the love of my life. At least we left before we had to go. And love won't play any games with you. Anymore if you don't want 'em to. So we better shake this old thing out the door. I'll always be thinkin' of you. I'll always love you though New York. I'll always love you though New York New York New York.
2484,M. Jagger/K. Richards). Let's drink to the hard working people. Let's drink to the lowly of birth. Raise your glass to the good and the evil. Let's drink to the salt of the earth. Say a prayer for the common foot soldier. Spare a thought for his back breaking work. Say a prayer for his wife and his children. Who burn the fires and who still till the earth. And when I search a faceless crowd. A swirling mass of gray and. Black and white. They don't look real to me. In fact they look so strange. Raise your glass to the hard working people. Let's drink to the uncounted heads. Let's think of the wavering millions. Who need leaders but get gamblers instead. Spare a thought for the stay-at-home voter. His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows. And a parade of the gray suited grafters. A choice of cancer or polio. And when I look in the faceless crowd. A swirling mass of grays and. Black and white. They don't look real to me. Or don't they look so strange. Let's drink to the hard working people. Let's think of the lowly of birth. Spare a thought for the rag taggy people. Let's drink to the salt of the earth. Let's drink to the hard working people. Let's drink to the salt of the earth. Let's drink to the two thousand million. Let's think of the humble of birth.

The deal was made in Denmark on a dark and stormy day. So he set out for Biafra to join the bloody fray. Through sixty-six and seven they fought the Congo war. With their fingers on their triggers knee-deep in gore. For days and nights they battled the Bantu to their knees. They killed to earn their living and to help out the Congolese. Roland the Thompson gunner.... His comrades fought beside him - Van Owen and the rest. But of all the Thompson gunners Roland was the best. So the CIA decided they wanted Roland dead. That son-of-a-bitch Van Owen blew off Roland's head. Roland the headless Thompson gunner. Norway's bravest son. Time time time. For another peaceful war. But time stands still for Roland. 'Til he evens up the score. They can still see his headless body stalking through the night. In the muzzle flash of Roland's Thompson gun. In the muzzle flash of Roland's Thompson gun. Roland searched the continent for the man who'd done him in. He found him in Mombassa in a barroom drinking gin. Roland aimed his Thompson gun - he didn't say a word. But he blew Van Owen's body from there to Johannesburg. Roland the headless Thompson gunner.... The eternal Thompson gunner. still wandering through the night. Now it's ten years later but he still keeps up the fight. In Ireland in Lebanon in Palestine and Berkeley. Patty Hearst heard the burst of Roland's Thompson gun and bought it.
2498,Fork lightning in your hall. Break the skin when you break the fall. I'll be the one to fix it up. Love children of the new age. Just a hippy with a weekly wage. There's no rebellion just a chance to be lazy. When fame is in your blood. You follow the science of love. Wave the magic wand. And hang on. Now the rest of us are living in a daze. Keep thinkin' 'bout the choice to be made. Here come the handmaidens of end time. Lost treasure from a primitive race. All the lives written on your face. Can't fill the canyons of yor mind. When fame is in your blood. You follow the science of love. Wave the magic wand. And hang on. Now you've changed. And jumbled the pieces you've changed. You're better before you talked. To a roomful of strangers. Here come the handmaidens of end time. When fame is in your blood. You follow the science of love. Wave the magic wand. All of your stars will fall. And all of your spells will break. So look out for number one. Fame is in your blood.
2499,(Cory George C. Jr./Cross Douglass). The loveliness of Paris. Seems somehow sadly gay. The glory that was Rome. Is of another day. I've been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan. And I'm coming home to my city by the bay. I left my heart in San Francisco. High on a hill it calls to me. To be where little cable cars. Climb halfway to the stars!. And the morning fog will chill the air. My love waits there (my love waits there) in San Francisco. Above the blue and windy sea. When I come home to you San Francisco. Your golden sun will shine for me!. I left my heart in San Francisco. High on a hill it calls to me. To be where little cable cars. Climb halfway to the stars!. And the morning fog will chill the air. I don't care. My love waits there in San Francisco. Above the blue and windy sea. When I come. When I come home to you San Francisco. Your golden sun will shine for me! Yeah.

2503,Crying out. Now you can't escape you are. buried in doubt. And it pulls you down. Now you're in too deep you may never get out. Such an awful fate. Tear it down. It's almost too late is the end coming now. As you scream out loud. You sever the peace til. your truth has been found. Is there nothing left to follow?. Is there nothing left to steal?.

2507,Your words are pretty but I already know who you are. I knew you before you met me long before we would part. Before you tricked me and laid on my bones. Before you kissed me and buried my hope. Before you stole my spirit and rode the show into the wall. Shore you up. They lay all their dreams on you. They let you in and you start to believe you're soft as a miracle. Unfurled I was new and unfurled. Innocent and open as any lamb. And hoping for paradise. Yeah I hate love. Yeah I hate love. So I hate love. Yeah I hate love. Love makes you desperate. And feeling a fool. Love makes you ruthless. And love makes you cruel. And love makes you crazy. With nothing but lies. Love promises nothing. And then your love dies. Unfurled I was new and unfurled. Innocent and open as any lamb. And hoping for paradise. Yeah I hate love. Yeah I hate love. So I hate love. Yeah I hate love. (Hey it's me. Call me).

2508,(Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe). . That's when Wendell Gee takes a tug. Upon the string that held the line of trees. Behind the house he lived in. He was reared to give respect. But somewhere down the line he chose. To whistle as the wind blows. Whistle as the wind blows with me. He had a dream one night. That the tree had lost its middle. So he built a trunk of chicken wire. To try to hold it up. But the wire the wire turned to lizard skin. And when he climbed inside. There wasn't even time to say. Goodbye to Wendell Gee. So whistle as the wind blows. Whistle as the wind blows with me. There wasn't even time to say. Goodbye to Wendell Gee. So whistle as the wind blows. Whistle as the wind blows with me. If the wind were colors. And if the air could speak. Then whistle as the wind blows. Whistle as the wind blows.
2509,It's sorted now. It makes no ifference and difference. To one suggests. Faint from lack of air. It needs a whistle with a twistle. But no one can hear. I didn't stay long. I have to go away to stay. As long as I could. So I'm happy here. Cos here is where the heart is. I know you think that too. Into Another. You And Me. Am I dead. Sleeping in hollow's head (X2). Listening to our tune. With headphone and volume on. I can read your lips. And in a clinical tone. I heard it said. Everything was beautiful. But nothing hurt. Into Another. You And Me. Am I dead. Sleeping in hollow's head (X2). Into Another. You And Me. Am I dead. Sleeping in hollow's head (X2)
2513,Two shots of happy one shot of sad. You think I'm no good well I know I've been bad.. Took you to a place now you can't get back.. Two shots of happy one shot of sad.. Walked together down a dead-end street. We were mixing the bitter with the sweet.. Don't try to figure out what we might have had.. Just two shots of happy one shot of sad.. I'm just a singer some say a sinner. Rolling the dice not always a winner.. You say I've been lucky well hell I made my own. Not part of the crowd not feeling alone.. Under pressure but not bent out of shape. Surrounded we always found an escape.. Drove me to drink but hey that's not all bad.. Two shots of happy one shot of sad.. Guess I've been greedy all of my life. Greedy with my children my lovers and my wife.. Greedy for the good things as well as the bad.. Two shots of happy one shot of sad.. Maybe it's just talk saloon singing. The chairs are all stacked the swingers stopped. swinging.. You say I hurt you you put the finger on yourself. Then after you did it you came crying for my help.. Two shots of happy one shot of sad.. I'm not complaining baby I'm glad.. You call it compromise well what's that?. Two shots of happy one shot of sad.. Two shots of happy one shot of sad.
2514,Every time you raise your voice. I see the greener grass. Every time you run for cover. I see this pasture. Every time we're in a funk. I picture a different choice. Anytime we're in a rut. This distant grandeur. My tendency to want to do away. feels natural and. My urgency to dream of softer places. feels understandable. The only way out is through. The faster we're in the better. The only way out is through. ultimately. The only way out is through. The only way we'll feel better. The only way out is through. ultimately. Every time that I'm confused. I think there must be easier ways. Everytime our horns are locked. on towel throwing. Everytime we're at a loss. we've bolted from difficulty. Anytime we're in stalemate. a final bowing. My tendency to want to hide away. feels easier and. The imeadicy of picturing another place. comforting to go. But I know. The only way out is through. The faster we're in the better. The only way out is through. ultimately. The only way out is through. The only way we'll feel better. The only way out is through. ultimately. We could just walk away. and hide our heads in the sand. We could just call it quits. only to start all over again. With somebody else. Everytime we're stuck. in struggle. I'm down for the count that day. Everytime I dream of quick fix. I'm assuaged. Now I know it's hard when it's through. And I'm damned if I don't. No quick fix way. What formerly was treatment silent. is now outdated. My tendency to want to run. feels unnatural now. The urgency to want to give to you. what I want most feels good. And I know. The only way out is through. The faster we're in the better. The only way out is through. ultimately. The only way out is through. The only way we'll feel better. The only way out is through. ultimately. The only way out is through. The faster we're in the better. The only way out is through. ultimately. The only way out is through. The only way we'll feel better. The only way out is through. ultimately
2516,(Cave / Coulais). Across the oceans across the seas. Over forests of blackened trees.. Through valleys so still we dare not breathe. To be by your side.. Over the shifting desert plains. Across mountains all in flames.. Through howling winds and driving rains. To be by your side.. Every mile and every year. For everyone a little tear.. I cannot explain this dear. I will not even try.. Into the night as the stars collide. Across the borders that divide. Forests of stone standing petrified. To be by your side.. Every mile and every year. For every one a single tear. I cannot explain this dear. I will not even try.. For I know one thing. Love comes on a wing. For tonight I will be by your side. But tomorrow I will fly.. From the deepest ocean to the highest peak. Through the frontiers of your sleep.. Into the valley where we dare not speak. To be by your side.. Across the endless wilderness. Where all the beasts bow down their heads.. Darling I will never rest. Till I am by your side.. Every mile and every year. Time and distance disappear. I cannot explain this dear no. I will not even try.. And I know just one thing. Love comes on a wing. And tonight I will be by your side.. But tomorrow I will fly away. Love rises with the day. And tonight I may be by your side.. But tomorrow I will fly tomorrow I will fly.

2534,The sun stops shining. And the sky starts falling. And the world stops spinning. And I'm right here. I'm right here. Stars stop twinkling. The ocean is dry. The winds stop blowing. And I'm right here. I'm right here. Come what may come what will. Come whatever I'll be right here still. So when I get old. The world gets cold. One thing I know is. I'm right here. I'm right here (woahh). No matter what the world decides to throw at me. I'm right here. There is only one thing I can guarantee. I'm right here. Who you can depend on and just where I'll be. I'm right here. I'm right here. The fans stop screaming. And the checks stop coming. My records stop selling. And I'm right here. I'm right here. My waist starts cleaving. And all my clothes don't fit no more. But I'm right here. I'm right here (yeah). Come what may come what will. Come whatever I'll be right here still. So when i get old. The world gets cold. One thing I know is. I'm right here. I'm right here. No matter what the world decides to throw at me. I'm right here. There is only one thing I can guarantee. I'm right here. Who you can depend on and just where I'll be. I'm right here. I'm right here. Through my good days. And through my bad days. And in between. When the kingdom is crumbling. I'm still the queen. So at my best or at my worst. Cuz both I've seen. Said it really don't matter. I don't care. Cuz the love's in me. Woah woah. Woah woah. Woah woah. No matter what!. No matter what the world decides to throw at me. I'm right here. There is only one thing I can guarantee. I'm right here. Who you can depend on and just where I'll be. I'm right here. I'm right here. I'm right here I'm right here
2535,Cold wind sad moonrise. Dark clouds in the sky. Storm ends the mourning time. Howling in the night. Vision of the land. After the horrid end. We build again from the start. Holy lenient heart. A treasure of the land. Torments have brought the end. We build again from the start. Holy lenient heart. Vision of the land. After the horrid end. We build again from the start. Holy lenient heart. A treasure of the land. Torments have brought the end. We build again from the start. Holy lenient heart. Visions come from the sea. Oceans bring to me. I reach the sand with a kiss. Treasures bristling from a bliss
2536,Your little hands wrapped around my finger. And it's so quiet in the world tonight. Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming. So I tuck you in and turn on your favorite nightlight. To you everything's funny. You got nothing to regret. I'd give all I have honey. If you could stay like that. (Chorus:). Oh darling don't you ever grow up don't you ever grow up. Just stay this little. Oh darling don't you ever grow up don't you ever grow up. It could stay this simple. I won't let nobody hurt you. Won't let no one break your heart. No one will desert you. Just try to never grow up. Never grow up. You're in the car on the way to the movies. And you're mortified your mama's dropping you off. At 14 there's just so much you can't do. And you can't wait to move out. Someday and call your own shots. But don't make her drop you off around the block. Remember she's getting older too. And don't lose the way that you dance around in your. PJs getting ready for school. (Chorus:). Oh darling don't you ever grow up don't you ever grow up. Just stay this little. Oh darling don't you ever grow up don't you ever grow up. It could stay this simple. No one's ever burned you. Nothing's ever left you scared. Even though you want to just try to never grow up. Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room. Memorize what is sounded like what your dad gets home. Remember the footsteps remember the words said. And all your little brother's favorite songs. I just realized everything I had is someday gonna be gone. So here I am in my new apartment. In a big city they just dropped me off. It's so much colder than I thought it would be. So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on. Wish I'd never grown up. I wish I'd never grown up. Oh I don't wanna grow up. Wish I'd never grown up. Could still be little. Oh I don't wanna grow up. Wish I'd never grown up. It could still be simple. (Chorus:). Oh darling don't you ever grow up don't you ever grow up. Just stay this little. Oh darling don't you ever grow up don't you ever grow up. It could stay this simple. Won't let nobody hurt you. Won't let no one break your heart. And even though you want to please try to never grow up. Don't you ever grow up. Just never grow up
2537,I wanna call the stars. Down from the sky. I wanna live a day. That never dies. I wanna change the world. Only for you. All the impossible. I wanna do. I wanna hold you close. Under the rain. I wanna kiss your smile. And feel the pain. I know what's beautiful. Looking at you. In a world of lies. You are the truth. And baby. Everytime you touch me. I become a hero. I'll make you safe. No matter where you are. And bring you. Everything you ask for. Nothing is above me. I'm shining like a candle in the dark. When you tell me that you love me. I wanna make you see. Just what I was. Show you the loneliness. And what it does. You walked into my life. To stop my tears. Everything's easy now. I have you here. And baby. Everytime you touch me. I become a hero. I'll make you safe. No matter where you are. And bring you. Everything you ask for. Nothing is above me. I'm shining like a candle in the dark. When you tell me that you love me. In a world without you. I would always hunger. All I need is your love to make me stronger. And baby. Everytime you touch me. I become a hero. I'll make you safe. No matter where you are. And bring you. Everything you ask for. Nothing is above me. I'm shining like a candle in the dark. When you tell me that you love me. You love me. When you tell me that you love me. . post by Lino GOnçalves PT
2538,I been knockin' on the door that holds the throne. I been lookin' for the map that leads me home. I been stumblin' on good hearts turned to stone. The road of good intentions has gone dry as bone. We take care of our own. We take care of our own. Wherever this flag's flown. We take care of our own. From Chicago to New Orleans. From the muscle to the bone. From the shotgun shack to the Super Dome. There ain't no help the cavalry stayed home. There ain't no one hearing the bugle blown. We take care of our own. We take care of our own. Wherever this flag's flown. We take care of our own. Where the eyes the eyes with the will to see. Where the hearts that run over with mercy. Where's the love that has not forsaken me. Where's the work that'll set my hands my soul free. Where's the spirit that'll reign reign over me. Where's the promise from sea to shining sea. Where's the promise from sea to shining sea. Wherever this flag is flown. Wherever this flag is flown. Wherever this flag is flown. We take care of our own. We take care of our own. Wherever this flag's flown. We take care of our own. We take care of our own. We take care of our own. Wherever this flag's flown. We take care of our own
2539,Paint your lips blue. Murder artistry. Heartbreak and romance. The cold is what you need for events such as this. It's better being numb if you're cracking at the heart.

2540,I like my music loud. Close my eyes and see a crowd. Day dreamin' on my bed. Neon lights in my head. Cinderella on my TV Video games killin' me.. Posters of Ratt and Miami Vice. Doin' time with Ginger Spice. Get the hell out get outta my room. And take your hands off the volume. I need to shout get outta my room. Leave me alone get outta my room. Let's party we're all here. Gettin' stuffed on salami and beer. Jumped to hard my bed's broke. Smoke so thick think I'm gonna choke. Now the neighbors are around. Says turn that shit down. I'm not breakin' the law. I wanna break you jaw. Get the hell out get outta my room. And take your hands off the volume. I need to shout get outta my room. Leave me alone get outta my room.
2543,I dream about how it's going to end. Approaching me quickly. Leaving a life of fear. I only want my mind to be clear. People making fun of me. For no reason but jealousy. I fantasise about my death. I'll kill myself from holding my breath. My suicidal dream. Voices telling me what to do. My suicidal dream. I'm sure you will get yours too. Help me comfort me. Stop me from feeling what I'm feeling now. The rope is here. Now I'll find a use. I'll kill myself. I'll put my head in a noose. My suicidal dream. Voices telling me what to do. My suicidal dream. I'm sure you will get yours too. Dreamin' about my death dream. Suicidal suicidal suicidal dream. I'm suicidal. Suicidal dream.

2559,Get yourself cooler. Lay yourself low. Coincidental murder. With nothing to show. With the judge’s constipation. Will go to his head. And his wife’s aggravation. You’ll soon end up dead. It’s the same old story. Same old song and dance my friend. It’s the same old story. Same old song and dance my friend. Gotcha with the cocaine. They found with your gun. No smooth face laywer. Could get ya undone. Say love ain’t the same. On the south side of town. You could look. But you ain’t gonna find it around. It’s the same old story. Same old song and dance my friend. It’s the same old story. Same old story. Same old song and dance. Fate comes a-knockin’. Doors start lockin’. Your old time connection. Change your direction. You ain’t gonna change it. Can’t rearrange it. Can’t stand the pain. When it’s all the same to you my friend. When you’re low down and dirty. From walkin’ the street. With your old hurdy gurdy. No one to meet. Said love ain’t the same. On the south side of town. You could look. But you ain’t gonna find it around. It’s the same old story. Same old song and dance my friend. It’s the same old story. Same old story. Same old song and dance
2562,Started on Thursday. At seven or maybe eight. You crashed into my world with a boom. You came over as a guest. I said I liked you and I confessed. By ten o'clock I was making fun of you. You stayed for a while. Then left with a smile. At least I made you happy. You make me happy too. It's kinda cheesy to say but. CHORUS. You're everything I want. When I'm with you all the hurting stops. You're the hand that fits my glove. And I'll never replace you. 'Cause I'll never find love so true. It's only been three days. You're playing the waiting game. Been acting cool when we're not together. I drove you home from school. When I'm with you I feel so true. I wish this feeling would last forever. I stare into space. My heart starts to race. At least I've got your picture. You gave me yesterday. It's kinda cheesy to say but. Chorus. Lookin back at us. Two years and we're goin' strong. That say that time flies when your having fun. I never want to be alone again. You're everything I want. When I'm with you all the hurting stops. You're the hand that fits my glove. No you're everything I want. You're everything I want. And I'll never replace you. 'Cause I've never felt love so true
2563,"It's late in the evening. she's wondering what clothes to wear. She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair. And then she asks me ""Do I look all right? "". And I say ""Yes you look wonderful tonight. "". We go to a party and everyone turns to see. This beautiful lady that's walking around with me. And then she asks me ""Do you feel all right? "". And I say ""Yes I feel wonderful tonight. "". I feel wonderful because I see. The love light in your eyes. And the wonder of it all. Is that you just don't realize how much I love you. It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head. So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed. And then I tell her as I turn out the light. I say ""My darling you were wonderful tonight. Oh my darling you were wonderful tonight. """
2566,I can never be the same that I was yesterday.. I'm loosing my mind I'm loosing control.. You tickled me so much that I can never be ok.. I think I can be with a serious face nomore.. Oh can't you see that this can't go on?. I'm loosing my calmness I go crazy.. Oh can't you see that tickling is killing me?. I'm loosing my calmness. My calmness yeah.. No one can take me now in the way they used to take.. I'm loosing my mind I'm loosing my reputation.. You tickled me so much that I can never be ok..
2567,I know he loved you. A long time ago. I ain't jealous of you. Just thought you should know. You were never good enough. for him or anything like me. So you might as well sit back. Cause I ain't trying to show maturity. X is the shape I drew through your face. In permanent marker oh yeah. Just like the mark you knew you were making. Who do you think you are?. To write on his heart in permanent marker. So I found that picture. Of you in that green dress. Sure had a good time. Cleaning up that mess. He found thirty other pieces but he'll never find them all. Tried to tape them back together. Now he knows to keep it off the wall. X is the shape I drew through your face. In permanent marker oh yeah. Just like the mark you knew you were making. Who do you think you are?. To write on his heart in permanent marker. Well I don't appreciate you calling him to reminisce. The only reason is you're seeing. Just how much better off he is. X is the shape I drew through your face. In permanent marker oh yeah. Just like the mark you knew you were making. Who do you think you are?. To write on his heart in permanent marker
2568,Professional jealousy can bring down a nation. And personal invasion can ruin a man. Not even his family will understand what's happening. The price that he's paying or even the pain. Professional jealousy started a rumour. And then it extended to be more abuse. What started out as just black propaganda. Was one day seen to be believed as truth. They say the truth is stranger than fiction. But a lie is more deadly than sin. It can make a man very bitter and angry. When he thinks that there's someone is going to win. Professional jealousy makes other people crazy. When they think you've got something that they don't have. What they don't understand is it's just not easy. To cover it all and stand where you stand. Professional jealousy makes no exception. It can happen to anyone at any time. The only requirement is knowing what's needed. And then delivering what's needed on time. The only requirement is to know what is needed. In doing the best you know how deliver on time. The only requirement is to know what is needed. Be best at delivering the product on time..

The strange we walk the touch we feel. Could you find a way to love us all?. Don't wake up. Show me stolen love. Everything I need. Take away from me humility. Over and over I fuss. But I can't seem to sleep as they cut. Oh no you can't hurt me. Break break breaking up. Break break break follow me. Break break breaking up. Break break break follow me. Break break breaking up. Break break break follow me. Break break breaking up. Break break break follow me. Break break breaking up. Break break break follow me. Break break breaking up. Break break can you hear me?. Break break breaking up. Break break break follow me. Break break breaking up. Can can can you hear me?. Oh show me your true ugly. The stranger you move. The sweeter you become. Now show me the good you've done. Show me the animal. You fucking animal. Don't feed us the animals. Cause we're not done with you. There's no good you've done. Oh show me your true ugly. The stranger you move. The sweeter you become. Now show me the good you've done

2575,You've got your friends and your places.. That's where you feel the safest. Boy you don't see. I'm standing here in the shadows. Learning how to let love go. When it has to be free. You've got your castles in the clouds. You don't need me now.. But if you should ever fall think you've lost it all. I will be there for you. And if you should lose your faith. The whole world turns away from you baby. One thing's still true. I will be there for you.. I read the news in the paper all the fear and the hatred. Baby who can you trust?. But I see the truth through the madness. Here's my love if you'll have it but if you don't want that much. Go as far as you can go as long as you know. But if you should ever fall think you've lost it all. I will be there for you. And if you should lose your faith. The whole world turns away from you baby. One thing's still true. I will be there for you.. And if the time should come. When all you depend upon is gone. Just look around and I'll be there. But if you should ever fall think you've lost it all. I will be there for you. And if you should lose your faith. The whole world turns away from you baby. One thing's still true (I will be there 2x). I will be there for you.. (Adriana)
2577,The world would be a lonely place. Without the one that puts a smile on your face. So hold me 'til the sun burns out. I won't be lonely when I'm down. 'Cause I've got you to make me feel stronger. When the days are rough and an hour seems much longer. I never doubted you at all. If stars collide will you stand by and watch them fall? [by and watch them fall]. So hold me ‘til the sky is clear. And whisper words of love right into my ear. 'Cause I've got you to make me feel stronger. When the days are rough and an hour seems much longer. Yeah when I got you. Oh! to make me feel better. When the nights are long they'll be easier together. Looking in your eyes. Hoping they won't cry. And even if you do. I'll be in bed so close to you. To hold you through the night. And you'll be unaware. And if you need me I'll be there. Yeah I've got you. Oh to make me feel stronger. When the days are rough and an hour seems much longer. Yeah when I got you to make me feel better. When the nights are long they'll be easier together. Oh when I've got you
2580,Take a look and see. What's become of me. Remember how it used to be. People that we'd meet. Were falling at your feet. You didn't eve see it. Time marches on ahead - enough said. There's only one way through it. Time marches on ahead - one day we'll see it. How there's a fine blue line. Running through it. We read each other's books. We gave each other looks. Like we couldn't trust ourselves. And we knew it. So tell me where you've been. And I'll show you were you're going. You can shout you can scream. Your way through it. Well time rushes an ahead - enough said. That's just the way we blew it. Time marches on ahead - one day you'll see it. Love is a fine blue line. Time races on ahead - enough said. That's just the way we blew it. Time marches on ahead - one day you'll see it. Love is the fine blue line. Running through it

2587,Well there's nothing worse than a passing friend. Who will die on you till the bitter end. There's nothing worse than a burning heart. Or a past that tears the world apart. I've been thinking about my situation. Nothing ventured nothing left to lose. When it's easier to just say nothing. I had thought about what I might lose. But through the child's eyes. There were feelings. Touching my violet skin. When the love games start appealing. YOu better get out and move on in. 'Cause there's nothing worse than a passing friend. Or a pioneer of a dying trend. Nothing worse than a silent ghost. Or to lose your head at the starting post. Ain't it always just a short vacation. When it's love it always has an end. Under the sheets of life it's just frustation. While the body goes in search again. But in the child's eyes. There were feelings. Touching my violet skin. When the love games start appealing. You better get out and move on in. 'Cause there's nothing worse than a passing friend. Who will die on you till the bitter end. There's nothing worse than a burning heart. Or a past that tears the world apart. Why do you love someone. Who wants to break your heart. Why do you need someone. Who wants to tear your world apart. No no not again. I was packing up my life in cases. For a hundred years or maybe more. I've been talking to a million people. Don't you think I should have known the score. But in the child's eyes. There were feelings. Touching my violet skin. When the love games start appealing. You better get out and move on in. 'Cause there's nothing worse than a passing friend. Who will die on you till the bitter end. There's nothing worse than a burning heart. Or a past that tears the world apart. Nothing worse than a passing friend. Or a pioneer of a dying trend. Nothing worse than a silent ghost. Or to lose your head at the starting post. No no not again.

2596,"A crow and a baby. Had an affair. The result was a landslide. The result was a dare. The result was a baby. Who wanted it all. Moved out of the doll's house. Moved out of the hall. With one wing on the town and a gleam in an eye of red. Said ""My father was a crow now I want all fathers dead. Find the fathers of this world treat them as a fatal foe. Put them in the deepest hole then cover the pit with snow"". With one wing on the town. And a gleam in an eye of red. I'm just trying to tell you what you'll come up against. If you venture from my side If you think you're so mature. You will end up in a field you will be someone's manure. Mushrooms growing from your back. Feeding some damn carrion bird. Do you want to contribute. To the corruption of the world?. With one wing on the town. And a gleam in an eye of red. A crow and a baby. Had an affair. My dream was the baby. The crow was your hair. Parts of me love parts of you. That at least is obvious. Give my baby back to me. You must see it's only just. With one wing on the town. And a gleam in an eye of red. With one wing on the town. And a gleam in an eye of red. With one wing on the town. And a gleam in an eye of red."

2602,Now we get off the train we take a backwards glance. Close our eyes and pay a tribute to the memories passed. I light a cigarette and hope that it will calm me down. Cause I can't beat the urge to tell you not to leave me now.. I see his cloud of smoke. Why does she does turn around. Why does she not get off. Is it too late now?. This won't be okay. This won't be alright. I won't see you tonight forever from now on. won't you turn this train around. Please make it stop now. I'm going to run and run until I'll reach you.

Ill press my nose against the window hoping you'll arrive. I don't know how to tell him soon that I won't be alive.. I hope shes okay. I hope shes alright. It's been a long time forever's just too long. I'm going to find you. And ill take you home tonight. And I'm going to run and run and run and run till I reach you..

2603,Skinny Lou you used to be that I couldn't see you sideways. Skinny Lou many times I wish I could be like you. turn away from the bay in my own ways. Just like you do Skinny Lou. There's a pull I can feel like gravity grabbing me sideways. The water railway station ticket to take me out of this town. Leave me somewhere. standing with the rain on my face again and again. Oh is it true you used to run with constellations. And the rock-a-billy boys will never see. Your artistry of taking your whole world in without taking it all on. Because you know it will be your skinny shoulders it rests upon. Skinny Lou I've a mind to sew a tapestry this time. For it feels like gold in the pocket of a coat. it would be easy to forget you ever had. to have it we do me and you. Oh is it true you used to run with constellations. And the rock-a-billy boys will never see. Your artistry of taking taking your whole world in. without taking it all on. For you know it will be your skinny shoulders it rests upon. Yes you know it will be your skinny shoulders it rests upon. Oh you know it will be your skinny shoulders it rests upon
2604,We're gonna drink enough tonight to drown the average army. By New Year's Day the next door neighbour will be goin' barmy. The milkman arrives at midday with his usual wisecrack. Who knows a girl with Wednesday legs so when's they gonna snap?. Chorus:. Why does everybody have to be so hale and hearty. Can't they see we're tryin' to have a party party party party. The last thing I remember I was talkin' to some fellas. Then she said she'd have a word for me with her good-looking mate. And handed me a pint-pot filled with Advocaat and Tizer. And I woke up in the flowerbed fearing fertilizer. Chorus. Bridge:. So shift yourself and shake your bod. You got bullet proof insurance from fire flood and Act of God. You got to learn from your mistakes. When you got a face like last week's Cornflakes. The doors and the window frames are by Pablo Picasso. The party decorations owned by Michelangelo. The fine music that you hear is by Stravinsky. with overall design by Leonardo daVinci. Chorus. Bridge:. So shift yourself and shake your bod. You got bullet proof insurance from fire flood and Act of God. You got to learn from your mistakes. When you got a face like last week's Cornflakes. Two boys are upstairs in your bed. Three girls are downstairs cryin'. The Alka Seltzer in the glass is roarin' like a lion. You think you've aged 10 years tonight and still never been kissed. So you overdose on aftershave and try to slash your wrist. Chorus and fade

There are ashes split through collective guilt. people rest at sea forever. Since they burnt you up collect you in a cup. for you the coal-black sea has no terror. Will your ashes float like some foreign boat. or will they sink absorbed forever. Will the Atlantic Coast have its final boast. nothing else contained you ever. Now the coal-black sea waits for me-me-me. the coal-black sea waits forever. When I leave this joint at some further point. the same coal-black sea will it be waiting.

No more laughter no more love. Since he went away. (One less bell to answer). (One less egg to fry). One less man to pick up after. No more laughter no more love. Since he went away. He went away...

I wish I was born bob dylan. I wish I was born bob dylan. They say either way you win. If you're feeling it right gotta hold it in. What is meant to be will be. But all the wisdom doesn't help me now. I'm scared and I gotta find out how to speak my mind. If metaphors are rosen. I'm still making mine. I hope you know what I mean when I'm mad at me. Cause I don't see what I'm in when I'm caught in between. I'm afraid the real you is alluring me. I wish I was born bob dylan. Had all the words to speak my feelings. I wish I stood up like rosa parks. And follow my heart and free the truth. Even if I stood alone. I didn't know how it was gonna go. Even if the water was cold. I'd take a deep breath and get it off my chest. I wish I was born bob dylan. I wish I was born bob dylan. I wish I was born bob dylan. With you I'm ripped wide open at the seams. I'm not that tough. But you could hear the song inside of me. But it's not enough. All the things I wanna say to you. Read it on my face. I wish I was born bob dylan. Had all the words to speak my feelings. I wish I stood up like rosa parks. And follow my heart and free the truth. Even if I stood alone. I didn't know how it was gonna go. Even if the water was cold. I'd take a deep breath and get it off my chest. I wish I was born bob dylan. Even if I stood alone. Didn't know how it was gonna go. Gotta get it off my chest. And hope for the best. I wish I was born bob dylan. I wish I was born bob dylan. I wish I was born bob dylan. I wish I was born bob dylan. I wish I was born bob dylan. I wish I was born bob dylan. I wish I was born bob dylan. I wish I was born bob dylan. I wish I was born bob dylan. I wish I was born bob dylan. I wish I was born bob dylan
2652,I find myself in question again. And I doubt this Love you've given to me. I hope you understand when I say. I need this time to myself. You speak your mind to me again. You force your words so deep within. You try to tell me how to live. But it's my life. I know your open arms too well. Cause I've lost myself there many times before. I need to slowly fall away. Far from the grip you have on me. You speak your mind to me again. You force your words so deep within. You try to tell me how to live. But it's my life. I find these words were never true. I've lost all my respect for you. I need to find my own way. It's my life. I gotta get away. One step away. I gotta get away. Just one step away. I gotta away you're pushing me away. I gotta get away. Well I'm gone
2654,You have led me to the sadness. I have carried this pain. On a back bruised nearly broken. I'm crying out to you. Chorus. I will sing of Your mercy. That leads me through valleys of sorrow. To rivers of joy. When death like a gypsy. Comes to steal what I love. I will still look to the heavens. I will still seek your face. But I fear you aren't listening. Because there are no words. Just the stillness and the hunger. For a faith that assures. Chorus. Alleluia alleluia. Alleluia alleluia. While we wait for rescue. With our eyes tightly shut. Face to the ground using our hands. To cover the fatal cut. Though the pain is an ocean. Tossing us around around around. You have calmed greater waters. Higher mountains have come down. Chorus. Alleluia alleluia.

2656,I don?t know what I was looking for and I?m not sure. I found it. I left a note to my dad saying Â?I will be gone for. about ten days or more?. With my Washburn guitar in a hard case and a bag full. of womenÂ?s clothes. I bought a stand by ticket to the airport in Stansted. It felt like I was home. I exchanged my Swedish money. I exchanged my Swedish life. And I exchanged my Swedish gender. But I kept the Swedish sin. I got a dirty old room at the Avon Hotel and the doves. woke me up in the morning. I was thinking to myself this could be heaven or above. I put my make up on and I went out on the street. I found a club for people like me. For an hour there I was a British queen dancing to the. British accent. So London took my virginity. London took my breath away. London took my past. But London left me the Swedish sin. Suddenly I heard this voice inside saying Â?youÂ?re. falling into disgraceÂ?. You werenÂ?t raised to behave this way. I started cry as I left the place. So London took...

2659,Once I was in love. Now it seems that time. Is better spent. Searching than in finding. But no one seems to know.. So don't say you lose. Don't say you lose. Don't say you win. And no one else will know. No one else will know.. When you're down you gather strength. To leave the ground. And when you're high. It makes you weak and you fall back down.. Once I was in love. Now it seems that time. Is better spent. Searching than in finding. But no one seems to know..

2674,"I tripped through a house. Of mirrors. Distorted my suspicions and fears. (I heard a whisper). There is a place where those. Secrets begin. (They had a list). I gave my name and they invited. Me in. (But here's the twist). A sign flickered and it started. To flash. ""Welcome Mr. and Mrs. Hush"". Haven't you tired of that. Darkness yet?. Didn't you cry your heart out?. It's only a dream. What is it about love you. Can't accept?. Are you ready?. Are you ready?. Are you ready?. To be. Mr. and Mrs. Hush. But it was something I just. Couldn't understand. Until I slipped my finger into. The band. Just think what those eyes. Might betray. Stare hard and now don't. Look away. Haven't you tired of that. Darkness yet?. Didn't you cry your heart out?. It's only a dream. What is it about love you. Can't accept?. Are you ready?. Are you ready?. Are you ready?. To be. Mr. and Mrs. Hush. I don't know if I'm deep down. Right inside her heart. Or outside her door. I don't know if I have the key. To either. Uncertain if I should take. Her hand or leave her. (I thought I saw her). It's a game of blindfold and bluff. (I thought I saw her). You know I love you. Is it ever enough?. (I thought I saw her). Oh what did I know. (I thought I saw her). Heigh-ho and there you go. (I thought I saw her). A voice that caresses and heels. Like spurs. (I thought I saw her). What if you walked in with some. Other fella. (I thought I saw her). Heat is rising. And red is the colour. (I thought I saw her). Green is the colour of my true. Love's eyes. (I thought I saw her). And green is the colour of. Those jealous disguises. Haven't you tired of that. Darkness yet?. Didn't you cry your heart out?. It's only a dream. What is it about love you.

2678,In the not very distant future. When everything will be free. There won't be any cute secrets. Let alone any novelty. You can say anything you want to. In your fetching cloak of anonymity. Are you feeling out of breath now?. In your desperate pursuit of infamy. Two lovers rocking up and down. In an elevator. 15 minutes later. They'll make a killing in the market. They knew how to work it. On that close circuit. My my it's a terrible disgrace. You'll find these days that there's. No hiding place. How proud are you. You have the knack. You're howling in a vacuum. Whatever I said about you. I didn't say it behind your back. I paid for my immortal sins. I know the enemy within you. As it seems these days. There is no hiding place. Next time someone wants to hurt you. Or set alight your effigy. Don't call on me to help you out. Don't come crying to me sympathy. You stay there with your daubs. And scratches. While I summon up the red machine. I'll handing someone matches. And carrying a can of kerosene. Walk up to me. And say what you said. See how brave you are. When I'm about this far away. You sit in judgment and bitch. Well baby that's rich. You're nothing but a snitch. My my it's a terrible disgrace. You'll find these days that there's. No hiding place
2680,How can I pretend that I don't see. What you hide so carelessly?. I saw her bleed. You heard me breathe. And I froze inside myself. And turned away. I must be dreaming. We all live. We all die. That does not begin to justify you. It's not what it seems. Not what you think. No I must be dreaming. It's only in my mind. Not in real life. No I must be dreaming. Help you know I've got to tell someone. Tell them what I know you've done. I fear you but spoken fears can come true. We all live. We all die. That does not begin to justify you. It's not what it seems. Not what you think. No I must be dreaming. It's only in my mind. Not in real life. No I must be dreaming. Not what it seems. Not what you think. I must be dreaming. Just in my mind. Not in real life. I must be dreaming

2688,A capital ship for an ocean trip. Was the walloping window blind. No gale that blew dismayed her crew. Or troubled the captain's mind. The man at the wheel was taught to feel. Contempt for the wildest blow. And it often appeared when the weather had cleared. That he'd been in his bunk below. The boatswain's mate was very sedate. Yet fond of amusement too. And he played hopscotch with the starboard watch. While the captain tickled the crew. And the gunner we had was apparently mad. For he stood on the cannon's tail. And fired salutes in the captain's boots. In the teeth of a booming gale. The captain sat in a commodore's hat. And dined in a royal way. On toasted pigs and pickles and figs. And gummery bread each day. But the rest of us ate from an odious plate. For the food that was given the crew. Was a number of tons of hot cross buns. Chopped up with sugar and glue. We all felt ill as mariners will. On a diet that's cheap and rude. And the poop deck shook when we dipped the cook. In a tub of his gluesome food. Then nautical pride we laid aside. And we cast the vessel ashore. On the gulliby isles where the poohpooh smiles. And the anagzanders roar. Composed of sand was that favored land. And trimmed in cinnamon straws. And pink and blue was the pleasing hue. Of the tickletoeteasers claws. We climbed to the edge of a sandy ledge. And soared with the whistling bee. And we only stopped at four o'clock. For a pot of cinnamon tea. From dawn to dark on rubagub bark. We fed till we all had grown. Uncommonly thin. Then a boat blew in. On a wind from the torriby zone. She was stubby and square but we didn't much care. And we cheerily put to sea. We plotted a course for the land of blue horse. Due west 'cross the peppermint sea
2689,Feeling the glass to tell how cold it's outside the car. Swerving aside from street to sea I can't see the stars. All is cold and all is dark all is cold and all is dark. No more star crossed tears. He is drawing near. Under the trees from moonlit fears we circle the start. Moving the leaves to flutter free it's after the heart. All is cold and all is dark all is cold and all is dark. No more star crossed tears. He is drawing near. Now salvation sings. Life that Jesus brings. Now reach out to be lost inside. No more star crossed tears. He is drawing near
2690,Sweet black magic coming down the line.. Sweet black magic coming down the line.. Don't worry little honey. 'Bout the money you'll be feelin' fine.. Cause I'm gonna see the doctor.

2692,Stop don't tell me how to feel. These scars will never heal overnight. I'm just searching for what's real. It's hard enough to deal with life. Learn to say fuck it take my time. Life's a bitch but I'll make it mine. Make it make it make it mine. Learn to take it as a sign. If you don't like me get in line. You won't break me break me with your lies. Sometimes you bleed for who you are. It's hard to love with a heart full of scars. I won't feed into your dark. I'll keep loving with a heart full of scars. (Heart full of scars). You're never gonna keep me down. Doesn't really matter what you say. I'm not living for yesterday. (Heart full of scars). I figured out how to turn it around. I'm learning how to bend not break. A full life is give not take. (Heart full of scars). Done with doubt and overthinking. Wait for it to sink in 'I'm enough'. Sick of tryna be your perfect. The pain is never worth it never was. Learn to say fuck it take my time. Life's a bitch but I'll make it mine. Make it make it make it mine. Learn to take it as a sign. If you don't like me get in line. You won't break me break me with your lies. Sometimes you bleed for who you are. It's hard to love with a heart full of scars. I won't feed into your dark. I'll keep loving with a heart full of scars. (Heart full of scars). You're never gonna keep me down. Doesn't really matter what you say. I'm not living for yesterday. (Heart full of scars). I figured out how to turn it around. I'm learning how to bend not break. A full life is give not take. (Heart full of scars). (Heart full of scars). (Heart full of scars). You're never gonna keep me down. Doesn't really matter what you say. I'm not living for yesterday. (Heart full of scars). I figured out how to turn it around. I'm learning how to bend not break. A full life is give not take. (Heart full of scars)

2708,Don't get smart or sarcastic. He snaps back just like elastic. Spare us the theatrics and the verbal gymnastics. We break wise guys just like matchsticks. What would the loved ones say. Your pride and joy is all blown up. What would the loved ones say. The bride and boy are barely grown up. You're not my particular poison. I've got nothing against you myself. You could have been a danger to the boys and girls. Now you're a danger to yourself. Oh what would the loved ones say. What would the loved ones say. Oh what would the loved ones say. What would the loved ones say. The ugly little scenes run round your bed. The ugly little dreams you get the needle and no thread. They stitched you up this time. They say you'll do. They bitch about your pretty face turning ugly on you. The butcher the baker and the bassline maker. Say you can leave her I can take her. You live your whole life like a minute or two later. One day its going to end sooner than greater. What would the loved ones say. He'll be remembered young and pretty. What would the loved ones say. Now he's a hit in every city. Now there's a name well never forget. There's one born every minute. Dont pin a medal on me yet. They might be waiting for you. (chorus). PPS I love you.

Give baby a cuddle. You're losing control. And you're sellin' your soul. Big mouth big money. You bitch you ain't that funny. Got somethin' to burn and love to waste.

2713,Pay no mind to his messed up hair. Pay no mind to the clothes he wears. It's just the hours he's been keepin'. Ain't been doing too much sleeping. They dyed his hair and hid his feathers. And told him he was Latin. 'Til he came chanting down the street. Like a cannibal in Manhattan. CHORUS:. Rattlebone. Rattlebone. Shake it for the war chief. All night long. Rattlebone. Rattlebone. Sweet medicine. To each his own. One sky above. One earth below. One sky above us. One earth below. CHORUS. Here's where we go off the map. Out past the power lines. Up that little side road without a sign. Hidden from the mainstream. The keepers of the ancient future. Keepers of the drum. They don't preserve it. They live it. Rattlebone. Rattlebone. Shake it for the war chief. All night long. Rattlebone. Rattlebone. Get down on your knees. And praise the dawn. CHORUS.
2715,Take me way back. Back in the day my father was a fuck up. Absolutely insane. He washed out the door straight out of my life. And he stole my innocence like a thief in the night. I had a hand full of cards start to catch me. Mom was blacked out I couldn't tell if she loved me. I gave up cause I didn't have a a family. I fell hard with nobody out to catch me. Somebody catch me. (Fear) I'm hopeless. (Hate) I'm helpless. (Love) I'm powerless. Gotta get out of this. (Fear) No choice in. (Hate) This crisis. (Love) Its hard and I'm so sick of this. Why did you abandoned me?. How could you just walk away?. (Fear) I'm hopeless. (Hate) I'm helpless. (Love) I'm powerless. Gotta get out of this. Now I'm out here. Walk in the streets. I'm a fatherless child. I'm a social disease. There's no love living in broken home. I never ever thought I have to live in alone. And then I talk to God said I was empty. How could anybody ever possibly love me. I know that it hurts at the minute. It'll drag you to hell if you let it. Drag you to hell if you let it. (Fear) I'm hopeless. (Hate) I'm helpless. (Love) I'm powerless. Gotta get out of this. (Fear) No choice in. (Hate) This crisis. (Love) Its hard and I'm so sick of this. Why did you abandoned me?. How could you just walk away?. (Fear) I'm hopeless. (Hate) I'm helpless. (Love) I'm powerless. Gotta get out of this. I've lost my innocence. You tried to take my hope. You tried to take me down. I found myself again. No you cant take my heart. No you cant take me down. Cause karma comes around. I'm hopelessI'm helplessI'm powerless. I gotta get out of this gotta get out of this. (Fear) I'm hopeless.

2717,"The sky fell over cheap Korean monster-movie scenery. And spilled into the mezzanine of the crushed capsule hotel. Between the Disney abattoir and the chemical refinery. And I knew I was in trouble but I thought I was in hell. So you look around the tiny room and you wonder where the hell you are. While the K.K.K. convention are all stranded in the bar. They wear hoods and carry shotguns in the main streets of Montgomery. But they're helpless here as babies 'cause they're only here on holiday. Chorus: What do we care if the world is a joke. (Tokyo Storm Warning). We'll give it a big kiss. We'll give it a poke. (Tokyo Storm Warning). Death wears a big hat 'cause he's a big bloke. (Tokyo Storm Warning). We're only living this instant. The black sand stuck beneath her feet in a warm Sorrento sunrise. A barefoot girl from Naples or was it a Barcelona hi-rise. Whistles out the tuneless theme song on a hundred cheap suggestions. And a million false seductions and all those eternal questions. Chorus. So they flew the Super-Constellation all the way from Rimini. And feasted them on fish and chips from a newspaper facsimile. Now dead Italian tourists bodies litter up the Broadway. Some people can't be told you know they have to learn the hard way. Holidays are dirt-cheap in the Costa del Malvinas. In the Hotel Argentina they can hardly tell between us. For Teresa is a waitress though she's now known as Juanita. In a tango bar in Stanley or in Puerto Margarita. She's the sweetest and the sauciest. The loveliest and the naughtiest. She's Miss Buenos Aires in a world of lacy lingerie. Chorus. Japanese got Jesus robots telling teenage fortunes. For all we know and all we care they might as well be Martians. They say gold paint on the palace gates comes from the teeth of pensioners. They're so tired of shooting protest singers. That they hardly mention us. While fountains fill with second-hand perfume. And sodden trading stamps. They'll hang the bullies and the louts that dampen down the day. Chorus. We braved the cold November air and the undertaker's curses. Saying ""Take me to the Folies Bergere and please don't spare the hearses"". For he always had a dream of that revolver in your purse. How you loved him 'til you hated him and made him cry for mercy. He said ""Don't ever mention my name there or talk of all the nights you cried. We've always been like worlds apart now you're seeing two nightmares collide""."
2718,A shadow life will only break your heart. It steals the light and tears us all apart. Like a shadow in the dark. I know your living in a shadow life. Better watch your step. Should you stumble you're gonna fall. Cause deadly secrets are the killing kind. Rope around your neck. It's a wonder you breathe at all. You turn a blind eye and I hold on. You're a fool; will it ever change. Why can't you ever see. The shadow life. Will only break your heart. Like I said before. It steals the light. And tears us all apart. Like a shadow in the dark. I can feel it when you're under me. There is something else. There is something else I can't let go. Never silenced to the misery. Feel it in your sex every time that we're all alone. And still you just deny it ohh. But I can't take this anymore. But I can't turn away. The shadow life. Will only break your heart. Like I said before. It steals the light. And tears us all apart. Like a shadow in the dark. Kick coming. It's coming. It haunts us. It tears us apart. Just like a shadow in the dark. You're a shadow in the dark. The shadow life. Will only break your heart. Like I said before. It steals the light. And tears us all apart. Like a shadow in the dark. I feel it when you're under me. There's a dirty secret to this misery yeah. The shadow life will only break your heart. Like a shadow in the dark. You're a shadow in the dark. You're a shadow in the dark
2719,See the late night talk show guest professional. A movie star and some kind of telectual. Ohhh. He's a she cause she's got more obsessional. Cause whenever I get uptight know you will. Ohhh. La la la la.... See the late night talk show guest I guess you will. A movie star is some kind telectual. WHO HA!. Ohhhh. La la la la...
2721,"I said remember this moment. In the back of my mind. The time we stood with our shaking hands. The crowds and stands went wild. We were the Kings and the Queens. And they read off our names. The night you danced like you knew our lives. Would never be the same. You held your head like a hero. On a history book page. It was the end of a decade. But the start of an age. Long live the walls we crashed through. How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you. I was screaming ""long live all the magic we made"". And bring on all the pretenders. One day we will be remembered. I said remember this feeling. I passed the pictures around. Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines. Wishing for right now. We are the kings and the queens. You traded your baseball cap for a crown. When they gave us our trophies. And we held them up for our town. And the cynics were outraged. Screaming ""this is absurd"". 'Cause for a moment a band of thieves. In ripped up jeans got to rule the world. Long live the walls we crashed through. How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you. I was screaming ""long live all the magic we made"". And bring on all the pretenders. I'm not afraid. Long live all the mountains we moved. I had the time of my life. Fighting dragons with you. I was screaming ""long live the look on your face"". And bring on all the pretenders. One day we will be remembered. Hold on to spinning around. Confetti falls to the ground. May these memories break or fall. Can you take a moment. Promise me this. That you'll stand by me forever. But if God forbid fate should step in. And force us into a goodbye. If you have children someday. When they point to the pictures. Please tell them my name. Tell them how the crowds went wild. Tell them how I hope they shine. Long live the walls we crashed through. I had the time of my life with you. Long long live the walls we crashed through. How the candlelight shined just for me and you. And I was screaming ""long live all the magic we made"". And bring on all the pretenders. I'm not afraid. Singing long live all the mountains we moved. I had the time of my life. Fighting dragons with you. And long long live the look on your face. And bring on all the pretenders. One day we will be remembered"
2722,The fields of eden. Are full of trash. And if we beg and we borrow and steal. We'll never get it back. People are hungry. They crowd around. And the city gets bigger as the country. Comes begging to town. Stuck between a rock. And a hard place. Between a rock and a hard place. This talk of freedom. And human rights. Means bullying and private wars and. Chucking all the dust in your eyes. And peasant people. Pooper than dirt. Who are caught in the crossfire with nothing. To lose but their shirts. Stuck between a rock. And a hard place. Between a rock and a hard place. You'd better stop put on a kind face. Between a rock and a hard place. We're in the same boat. On the same sea. And we're sailing south. On the same breeze. Building dream churches. With silver spires. And our rogue children. Are playing loaded dice. Between a rock and a hard place. You'd better stop. Give me truth now. Don't want no slam. I'd be hung drawn and quartered for a sheep. Just as a well as a lamb. Stuck between a rock. And a hard place. Between a rock and a hard place. You'd better put a stop. Put on a kind face. Can't you see what you've done to me
2723,Tell me that you want me baby. Tell me that it's true. Say the magic words and I will change the world for you. Not before the broken hearted. Marching through the streets. Every cities burning to the ground under your feet. I wanna hold you. My skies are turning black. Feels like a heart attack. (And I) Do anything you ask. I wanna hold you bad. Melt the polar ice caps baby. Watch them flood the earth. I'd do anything to show you what your love is worth. Won't you show me your devotion?. To heal my aching heart. It's like a neutron bomb explosion tearing me apart. I wanna hold you. My skies are turning black. Feels like a heart attack. (And I) Do anything you ask. I wanna hold you bad. Attention please we interrupt this program with some disturbing news. World wide evacuation we're going to lose we've pulverised the nation. I guess it shows that's just the love you do. I wanna hold you. My skies are turning black. Feels like a heart attack. (And I) Do anything you ask. I wanna hold you bad bad bad. Do anything you ask. I wanna hold you bad

2729,Let's let the world just take its shape. I'll let my face be your blank page. Let my dreams be your escape. You'll just let me come home. Oh I'm a panic I can't explain. I'm prepared to make all of your mistakes. Stricken like a flower being bent by the rain. Won't you let me come home. Let me come home. Let me come home. Can't you see my heart is boiling. Can't you see my heart is boiling. Life is short but the lines are long. Everybody dies but we're not gone. Won't you please help me sing along. Let me come home. Birds all sing and no one knows why. They were never asked and it makes me cry. Hello always sounds like goodbye. Please let me come home. Let me come home. Let me come home. Can't you see my heart is boiling. Can't you see my heart is boiling
2731,"The static comes in slow. You can feel it grow. Our stream of conscience flows. Under the streets below. Ohhhhh ohhhhhh. Ohhhhh ohhhhhh. The rivers made a sound. Still running underground. Runs like a silent flood. We run as thick as blood. Can you hear it rise?. Up from the ground. Can't drown it out. Can you hear it now?. - Chorus -. This is the sound of a heartbeat!. This is the sound from the discontented mouths. Of a haunted nation. We are the voice of breaking down!. Can you hear me? This is the sound!. Of a desperation bound by a heart collision. We are the voice of breaking down!. The static comes alive. Beneath the broken skies. John Perkins said it right. ""Love is the final fight"". Ohhhhh Ohhhhhh. Ohhhhh Ohhhhhh. Let it rise above! Rise above!. There is no sound. Louder than love. - Chorus -. This is the sound of a heartbeat!. This is the sound from the discontented mouths. Of a haunted nation. We are the voice of breaking down!. Can you hear me? This is the sound!. Of a desperation bound by a heart collision. We are the voice of breaking down!. Down down down. Let it rise above. Up from the ground. You can't drown it out. Can you hear it now?. - Chorus -. This is the sound of a heartbeat!. This is the sound from the discontented mouths. Of a haunted nation. We are the voice of breaking down!. Can you hear me? This is the sound!. Of a desperation bound by our fallen condition. We are the voice of breaking down!. This is the sound this is the sound! >"

2738,So you're still thinking of me. Just like I know you should. I can not give you everything. You know I wish I could. I'm so high at the moment. I'm so caught up in this. Yeah we're just young dumb and broke. But we still got love to give. While we're young dumb. Young young dumb and broke. Young dumb. Young young dumb and broke. Young dumb. Young young dumb and broke. Young dumb broke high school kids. Just a young gun with a quick fuse. I was uptight I wanna let loose. I was dreaming of bigger things. And wanna leave my old life behind. Not a yes sir not a follower. Fit the box fit the mold. Have a seat in the foyer take a number. I was lightning before the thunder. Thunder thunder thunder thun. Thunder thun-thun-thunder thunder. Thunder thunder thun. Thunder thun-thun-thunder thunder. Thunder feel the thunder. Lightning then the thunder thunder. Thunder feel the thunder. Lightning then the thunder thunder. Thunder thunder thunder. We have so much in common. We argue all the time. You always say I'm wrong. I'm pretty sure I'm right. They say you're basic they say you're easy. You're always riding in the backseat. Now I'm smiling from the stage. While you were clapping in the nose bleeds. While we're young dumb. Young young dumb and broke. Young dumb. Young young dumb and broke. Young dumb. Young young dumb and broke. Young dumb broke high school kids. Thunder feel the thunder. Lightning then the thunder thunder. Thunder feel the thunder. Lightning then the thunder thunder. Oh yeah. Nah yeah. Oh no oh yeah. Young dumb. Young young dumb and broke.

2739,Hang out the flags a new world order's on the way. Start singing now a song to reach the joyful day. Just when we thought the time was right for celebrating. The music of the spheres. What's this another boat of fleeing refugees on a sea of childrens' tears. Once more the sound of crying. Is number one across the earth. Once more the sound of crying. Is number one across the earth. We're only men remember. Doin' what we can. Sometimes I think that God is working to a plan. Then other times I swear that He is improvising. Dischordant and remote. Another orphaned baby in a failed uprising. Another real bum note. Once more the sound of crying. Is number one across the earth. Once more the sound of crying. Is number one across the earth. Once more the sound of crying. Once more the sound of crying.... And if youre listening out there. You could consider this a prayer.... Well who am I to tell you how to run your business. When you could strike me blind. What kind of noise we gotta make down here. Before we destroy your peace of mind?. Once more the sound of crying. Is number one across the earth. Once more the sound of crying. Is number one across the earth. Once more the sound of crying. Once more the sound of crying.... And if youre listening out there. You could consider this a prayer.... The sound of crying...
2740,I was a quick wit boy. Diving too deep for coins. All of your straight light eyes. Wide on my plastic toys. And when the cops closed the fair. I cut my long baby hair. Stole me a dog-eared map. And called for you everywhere. Have I found you?. Flightless bird jealous weeping. Or lost you?. American mouth. Big pill looming. Now I'm a fat house cat. Nursing my sore blunt tongue. Watching the warm poison rats. Curl through the wide fence cracks. Pissing on magazine photos. Those fishing lures thrown in the cold and clean. Blood of Christ mountain stream. Have I found you?. Flightless bird grounded bleeding. Or lost you?. American mouth. Big bill stuck going down
2741,(Rick Astley/D. Spatsley). The love has gone. The love has gone will we ever be the same. The feelings wrong the joy has turned to pain. Wake up beside you and hear you breathing. And I can feel you in my arms. No one can know just how I'm feeling. Knowing that our love can come to no harm. But as I open my eyes. Then I start to realise. That you're gone and I can't go on. The love has gone will we ever be the same. The feeling's wrong the joy has turned to pain. The love is gone will we ever be the same. The feeling's wrong the joy has turned to pain. What have I done girl to make you leave me. Didn't I love you for all those years. If you open your eyes. Baby then you'll realise. That you're wrong and I can't go on. You know I can't go on. The love has gone will we ever be the same. The feeling's wrong the joy has turned to pain. The love is gone will we ever be the same. The feeling's wrong the joy has turned to pain. Nothing will ever come between us. If you will just take me back once more. I'll show you just how much I love you. If you'll just come walking through that door. The love has gone will we ever be the same. The feeling's wrong the joy has turned to pain. The love is gone will we ever be the same. The feeling's wrong the joy has turned to pain. . (chorus to fade).
2742,Gigi. Am I a fool without a mind?. Or have I nearly been too blind to realize. Oh Gigi. While you've been growing up before my eyes. Gigi. You're not all that funny or quick little girl I knew. No overnight there's been a breathless change in you. Oh Gigi. While you were trembling on the brink. Was I out yonder somewhere blinking at a star?. Oh Gigi. Have I been standing up too close or back too far?. When did your sparkle turn to fire?. And your warmth become desire. Oh what miracle has made you the way you are?. When did your warmth become desire?. And your sparkle turn to fire?. Oh what miracle has made you the way you are?. Oh Gigi.
2744,well i don't know what to say. because there's truth to what you say. i know it kills you i'm this way. there's something different every day. [chorus]. could it be that i never had the chance to grow inside?. could it be that my habit is to find a place to hide?. could it be that sometimes i say things just to disagree?. could it be that i'm only being me?. not easy living in my mind. a little peace is hard to find. my every thought is undermined. by all the history inside. [chorus]. [bridge]. i know i hear the words you said. over and over again. i just can't get them through my head. there's just too many voices. must be like living with the dead. waiting for me to begin. to do the things i have said. and for this i'm sorry. so there's some truth to what you say. [chorus].

2752,Guess I had to find out the hard way. The things that I have come here to learn. Fire of this pleasure it can warm me. But in the end it only burns. He could put me high on a pedestal. He could rob me of my shame. He could hold me down under water. Till I could not remember my own name. In my mind I see the house I’m buildin’. In my hands the hammer and the nail. Gonna send my wishes up to Glory. Gonna shake that devil off my trail. In my time I’ve done some meanness. Brought the ones I love so much pain. Pride it was eatin’ all my heart away. My soul it was rustin’ in the rain. And all these sins I am confessin’. They still come knockin’ on my door. But I know better than to answer. I tell them that girl don’t live here anymore. In my mind I see the house I’m buildin’. In my hands the hammer and the nail. Gonna send my wishes up to Glory. Gonna shake that devil off my trail. Every livin’ thing is callin’ out to me. The leaves on the trees wave me on. Got a wind to lift me when I’m fallin’. Got a road to put my feet upon. In my mind I see the house I’m buildin’. In my hands the hammer and the nail. Gonna send my wishes up to Glory. Gonna shake that devil off my trail. In my mind I see the house I’m buildin’. In my hands the hammer and the nail. Gonna send my wishes up to Glory. Gonna shake that devil off my trail. Gonna shake that devil off my trail. Gonna shake that devil off my trail

2758,I'm driving a big lazy car rushin' up the highway in the dark. I got one hand steady on the wheel and one hand's tremblin' over my heart. It's pounding baby like it's gonna bust right on through. And it ain't gonna stop till I'm alone again with you. A friend of mine became a father last night. When we spoke in his voice I could hear the light. Of the skies and the rivers the timberwolf in the pines. And that great jukebox out on Route 39. They say he travels fastest who travels alone. But tonight I miss my girl mister tonight I miss my home. Is it the sound of the leaves. left blown by the wayside. That's got me out here on this spooky old highway tonight. Is it the cry of the river. With the moonlight shining through. That ain't what scares me baby. What scares me is losing you. They if you die in your dreams you really die in your bed. But honey last night I dreamed my eyes rolled straight back in my head. And God's light came shinin' on through. I woke up in the darkness scared and breathin' and born anew. It wasn't the cold river bottom I felt rushing over me. It wasn't the bitterness of a dream that didn't come true. It wasn't the wind in the grey fields I felt rushing through my arms. No no baby it was you. So hold me close honey say you're forever mine. And tell me you'll be my lonely valentine.

I'm not gonna get too sentimental. Like those other sticky valentines. Cause I don't know if you are loving somebody. I only know it isn't mine. Alison. I know this world is killing you. Oh Alison. My aim is true. Well I see you got a husband now. Did you leave your pretty fingers. Lying in the wedding cake. You used to hold him right in your hand. I bet it took all he could take. Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking. When I hear the silly things you say. I think somebody better put out the big light. Cause I can't stand to see you this way. Alison. I know this world is killing you. Oh Alison. My aim is true

Repeat chorus. Hear me talkin' to ya. Mother Nature's a clever girl. She relies on habits. Now you take two hares with no cares. Pretty soon you've got a room full of rabbits.

2772,Baby baby brush the dust of youth from your shoulder. Because the years of threading daisies lie behind you now. Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told. Place your ragged doll with all the toys and paints and deeds. I will show you a game where the winner never wins. Let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore. Let me sleep beside you. Lock away your childhood and throw away the key. For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals. We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger. Child you're a woman now your heart and soul are free. I will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together. Let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore. Let me sleep beside you. Your darkened eyes throw mystery. But your lips are void of history. You could not imagine that it could happen this way could you. I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'll like to hear. Let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore. Let me sleep beside you.
2773,Please don't come around talkin' bout that you love me. Cause that love shit just ain't for me. I don't wanna hear that you adore me. And I know that all you're doing is running your mind games. Don't you know that game beats game?. So your best bet is to be straight with me. So you say you wanna talk let's talk. If you won't talk I'll walk yeah it's like that. Got a new man he's waiting out back. Now what! Whatcha' think about that?. Now when I say I'm through I'm through. Basically I'm through with you. Whatcha' wanna say?. Had to have it your way had to play games. Now you're begging me to stay. Chorus. There u go lookin' pitiful. Just because I let you go. There u go talkin' bout you want me back. But sometimes it be's like that so. There u go talkin' bout you miss me so. that you love me so Why I let you go?. Yeah you know cause your lies got old. Look at you there u go!. Please don't come around talkin' bout how you changed. How you said goodbye to what's her name. All it sounds like to me is new game. And I was right when I thought I'd be much better off withoutyou. Had to get myself from round you. Cause my life was all about you. So you say you wanna talk I don't. Say you wanna change I won't. Yeah it's like that. Had your chance won't take you back. Now what! Whatcha' think about that?. and When I say I'm through I'm through. Basically I'm through with you. Whatcha' wanna say?. Had to have it your way had to play games. Now you're begging me to stay. CHORUS. Oooh don't you wish you could turn the hands of time?. Don't you wish that you still were mine?. Don't you wish I'd take you back?. Don't you wish that things were simple like that?. Didn't miss a good thing til' it's gone. But I knew it wouldn't be long. Til' you came running back missing my love THERE U GO!!!. CHORUS
2776,I think these hands have felt a lot. I don't know what have I touched. I think these eyes have seen a lot. I don't know maybe they've seen too much.. I think this brain has thought a lot. Searching trying to find the crutch. I think this heart has bled once too often. This time it's bled a bit too much.. Too much of anything too much for me. Too much of everything gets too much for me.. I can't remember before '49. But I know that '48 was there. My ears let in what I should speak out. Hmmm there's something in the air.. Ooh I've overloaded on my way. Bye bye bye bye you better keep in touch.. Think your ears hear a whole lot of music. And like me they've caught a bit too much.. Too much of anything is too much for me. Too much of everything gets too much for me.. I think these hands have felt a lot. I don't know what have I touched. I think these eyes have seen a lot. I don't know maybe they've seen too much.. I think this brain has thought a lot. Oh searching trying to find the crutch. I think these ears hear a whole lot of music. And like me they've heard a bit too much.. Too much of anything is too much for me. Too much of everything gets too much for me..
2778,(M. Jagger/K. Richards). Fling you out into orbit. No one's going to hear you shout. And fools aren't going to follow. You don't send the sleaze about. Now you're sad sad sad. Sad sad sad. Sad sad sad. But you're gonna be fine. The elephant's in the bedroom. Throwing all his weight about. And I'm locked in the bathroom. Your screaams are gonna drown me out. Now you're sad sad sad. Sad sad sad. Sad sad sad. But you're gonna be fine. I got a cold chill. I get a cool thrill. Are you ready for the gilded cage. Are you ready for the tears of rage. Come on baby don't let them drown you out. Now you're sad sad sad. Sad sad sad. Sad sad sad. But you're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine......
2779,Oh farewell you streets of sorrow. And farewell you streets of pain. I'll not return to feel more sorrow. Nor to see more young men slain. Through the last six years I've lived through terror. And in the darkened streets the pain. Oh how I long to find some solace. In my mind I curse the strain. So farewell you streets of sorrow. And farewell you streets of pain. No I'll not return to feel more sorrow. Nor to see more young men slain. There were six men in Birmingham. In Guildford there's four. That were picked up and tortured. And framed by the law. And the filth got promotion. But they're still doing time. For being Irish in the wrong place. And at the wrong time. In Ireland they'll put you away in the maze. In England they'll keep you for seven long days. God help you if ever you're caught on these shores. The coppers need someone. And they walk through that door. You'll be counting years. First five then ten. Growing old in a lonely hell. Round the yard and the stinking cell. From wall to wall and back again. A curse on the judges the coppers and screws. Who tortured the innocent wrongly accused. For the price of promotion. And justice to sell. May the judged by their judges when they rot down in hell. May the whores of the empire lie awake in their beds. And sweat as they count out the sins on their heads. While over in Ireland eight more men lie dead. Kicked down and shot in the back of the head.
2780,That pencil smell. reminds me of school.. The clock on the wall. I can no longer fool.. Time to get in my car.. Been so dull tired and tight.. Time to trust these old tires.. Time to not say goodnight.. Jesus rides with me.. His will is plain to feel.. Come on you can be.. Got yourself to steal.. He's everywhere. sends me straight across the plain.. He's in your hair. he'll forgive me my pain.. You're my girl don't you show it.. To know you know is to know it.. When you can't trust yourself. baby trust someone else.. Jesus rides with me.. His will is plain to feel.. Come on you can be.. Got yourself to steal.. You're my girl don't you show it.. To know you know is to know it.. When you can't trust yourself. baby trust someone else.. Ride with me.. Ride with me.. Ride with me.
2781,It's gonna take a lotta love. To change the way things are.. It's gonna take a lotta love. Or we won't get too far.. So if you look in my direction. And we don't see eye to eye. My heart needs protection. And so do I.. It's gonna take a lotta love. To get us thru the night.. It's gonna take a lotta love. To make things work out right.. So if you are out there waitin'. I hope you show up soon. You know I need relatin'. Not solitude.. Gotta lotta love. Gotta lotta love.. It's gonna take a lotta love. To change the way things are.. It's gonna take a lotta love. Or we won't get too far.. It's gonna take a lotta love. To change the way things are.. It's gonna take a lotta love
2784,Burning inside. (I cross myself. it doesn't help). because I'm not smart enough. (I'm digging into. hot white). learning not to lie. (we cross it out. and stay away). burning inside. we cross it out and stay away.
2785,When you find love. And it gets away. If it comes back to you. Then it will stay. Well maybe it's true. As dumb as it sounds. I ain't gonna stop you. From looking around. So let your eyes wander. Wild and free. Sooner or later. You will look back. To me. Love can be sharp. Make no mistake. Flatter a good heart. Then watch it break. It'll cut you to the bone. Just to see you bleed out. But that doesn't mean no. I'm somebody else. So let your eyes wander. The moment you think. You see something better. Better than me. So let your eyes wander. Wander away. And I'll look no further. You will come back one day. Followed every word that I have ever heard. And I still don't know what to say. I always think I'm losing. When my lips are moving. Time to shut up anyway. Followed every line. That I remember trying. But they never worked in the end. No more need for talking. If you feel like walking. You're gonna walk anyway. I know you can tell. The difference between. One lonely tear falling. And a season of rain. So let your eyes wander. Wander away. Your heart is young. And longing to stray. Let your eyes wander. Wild and free. Sooner or later. They will look back. They will look back. They will look back. To me
2787,Monday mourning. Tears are falling down like fluid pain. And it?s a long lost Monday morning. The telling words I like to learn. Are dying on your lips. As the morning through my fingers slips. Ooo-oooh a-haaaaaa. I find myself in times like this. Quite amazed ?how eager everything is to go wrong ?around me. Monday mourning. tries to wound me?. Eyes look hurt again. For have I asked and will never ask again. For I have asked I will never ask again
2788,Dragged up raised tough. Born a mistake. Learned fast the golden rule. Never give just take. Did no favors gave no quarter. You all know the story 'bout. The lamb's broadway slaughter.. Turning a new leaf. Turning a new leaf. Turning a new leaf. Street wise cat's eye's. Showbusiness smile. Lookin' for today's mark. On the golden mile. Book wise movie eyed. So cool dudes.. Ain't gonna do no talking. When they find out they been used.. Turning a new leaf. Turning a new leaf. Turning a new leaf. Got to make some time. Go through the changes. My whole life needs some rearrangin'. Self styled reject. Ambitious wisher. Also ran life style. Guaranteed user like a. Campaign promise from a three time loser. Got to make my move soon. Because beggars can't be choosers. So I'm. Turning a new leaf. Turning a new leaf. Turning a new leaf. . (McCafferty Cleminson Charlton Agnew Sweet).

2789,You try your hardest to perfect your explanations.... You lie until they've run out of questions. You can only move as fast as who's in front of you. And if you assume just like them. What good will it do?. So find out for yourself. So your ignorance will stop bleeding through.. You can breathe today. Only one thing. Big enough to fill the void that's inside of you. It's just a breath away. You can breathe today. So many lies swirling All around You. You're suffocating. The emtpy shape in you. Steals your breath you're suffocating. Logic forces me to believe in this. And I have learned to see. And I can only say what I've seen and heard. And only you can choose. And every choice you make will effect you. Suit your own self. You can breathe today. So many lies swirlingAll around you. you're suffocating. The empty shape in you. Steals your breath you're suffocating. BREATHE. Big enough to fill the void that's inside of you. It's just a breath away. So many lies swirling All around you. You're suffocating. The empty shape in you Steals your breathe. You're suffocating. Breathe Today
2792,Deja Vu. Deja vu. I must learn to protect myself. I'm not a man of violence. I must learn to protect myself. From the sins of science. People came and broke the law. Broke the vows of silence.

2795,I had a love. Sweeter than you'll know. Oh I had a lifetime in a moment. He was a boy. I loved so tenderly. He could have been. But he walked away - oh oh oh oh. Baby don't go. I thought maybe I should have. Told you long before. Something inside is erasing. The time back to the memory-. When you were mine..
2796,Blue eyes just smile to the world. Full of dreams and with fascination. Too soon she saw that her hands were chained. And pulled without any freedom. It's always the same. They fear no way out. I cannot break it. I can't take it no more. It's burning me up inside. Lost all my tears can't cry. No Reason no meaning. Just hatred. No matter how hard I try. You fear the beast inside. It's growing it's waiting. Just to hurt you. This heart was hurt by the lights and. I see your world that tries to deny us. Now everything that I love has died. Or has been shattered to pieces. It's always the same. They fear no way out. I cannot break it. I can't take it no more. It's burning me up inside. Lost all my tears can't cry. No Reason no meaning. Just hatred. No matter how hard I try. You fear the beast inside. It's growing it's waiting. Just to hurt you. (Just to hurt you). (Just to hurt you). Can't you see their eyes. What lies inside. They've given up. They no longer shine. Too soon they'll close. With one last cry. Before they turn to light. It's burning me up inside. Lost all my tears can't cry. No Reason no meaning. Just hatred. No matter how hard I try. You fear the beast inside. It's growing it's waiting. Just to hurt you
2798,Picture me walking on Bleeker & 7th. Picture me thinking of less than ever. Picture me stuck in a cab going crosstown. Reaching for the dial on the stereo when you song comes on. Picture me falling apart. Picture me falling apart again. Picture me falling apart ‐ just as I was on my feet again. Picture me falling apart ‐ I will get myself back on the mend. Picture me falling apart. Picture me keeping my mind on what matters. Picture me watching the clouds as they scatter ‐ like I don't care. Picture me riding a train going out of tour. Reaching for a magazine the cover's got your face on it. Picture me falling apart. Picture me falling apart again. Picture me falling apart ‐ just as I was on my feet again. Picture me falling apart ‐ I will get myself back on the mend. Picture me falling apart. I keep it together like you were never mind. Picture me falling apart. Picture me falling apart ‐ just as I was on my feet again. Picture me falling apart ‐ I will get myself back on the mend. Picture me falling apart

And I believe in Love. And I know that you do too. And I believe in some kind of path. That we can walk down me and you. So keep your candle burning. And make her journey bright and pure.

So get yourself ready for our gatecrash.... Well me and my buddies are going to your party tonight. We don't care if we got no invite. We don't care if we cause a splash. Gonna drink a lot of whiskey grab a little.... Gatecrash gatecrash. Get yourself ready for a real bash. Hide your ladies'cause we'll be talkin' trash. Snort your cocaine smoke your grass. So get yourself ready for our gatecrash.... . (written by Nazareth). copyright 1982 Fool Circle Music Limited. all rights reserved.. lyrics used by permission. reproduction prohibited.
2848,Who's that stomping all over my face?. Where's that silhouette I'm trying to trace?. Who's putting sponge in the bells I once rung. And taking my gypsy before she's begun. To singing the meaning of what's in my mind. Before I can take home what's rightfully mine.. Joinin' and listenin' and talkin' in rhymes. Stoppin' the feeling to wait for the times.. Who's saying baby that don't mean a thing. 'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing.. And who's all hung-up on that happiness thing?. Who's trying to tune all the bells that he rings?. And who's in the corner and down on the floor. With pencil and paper just counting the score?. And who's trying to act like he's just in between?. The line isn't black if you know that it's green.. Don't bother looking you're too blind to see. Who's coming on like he wanted to be.. Who's saying baby that don't mean a thing. 'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing.. And who's coming home on the old nine-to-five?. Who's got the feeling that he came alive. Though havin' it sharin' it ain't quite the same. It ain't no gold nugget you can't lay a claim. Who's seeing eyes through the crack in the floor. There it is baby don't you worry no more. Who should be sleepin' but is writing this song. Wishin' and a-hopin' he weren't so damned wrong.. Who's saying baby that don't mean a thing.

2851,Sometimes you can't remember where you spent the night. Sometimes your best friends are smoke and neon lights. But I can't get enough. Give me power get me up on a stage (headin' up). I see a hot one and I'm ready to play (get enough). Pretty baby (headin' up). You know I'm crazy yeah! yeah! yeah!. I've got the feeling. In my blood and in my bones. They've got each other tonight. But I'm still all alone. When the show is over when the show is over ooh ah!. Sometimes it falls apart but you can let it go. Sometimes you've got the drugs but you can't say no. (they've got each other tonight)

2858,Halfway through the night. I wake up in a dream. Echoes in my head. Make every whisper turn into a scream. I dreamed I could fly. Out in the blue. Over this town. Following you. Over the trees. Subways and cars. I'd try to find out. Who you really are. In the middle of the night. Cool sweatin' in my bed. Got the windows open wide. Thinkin' about all the things you said. I wish I could fly. Out in the blue. Over this town. Following you. I'd fly over rooftops. The great boulevards. To try to find out. Who you really are. Who you really are. I wish I could fly now. I wish I could fly now. I wish I could fly now. I wish I could fly. Around and around. Over this town. The dirt on the ground. I'd follow your course. Of doors left ajar. To try to find out. Who you really are. Who you really are. Fly fly fly. I wish I could fly. I wake up in a dream. (in the middle of the night). I wish I could fly.... (in the middle of the night). I wish I could fly.
2859,Put your lips close to mine. As long as they don't touch. Out of focus eye of eye. Till the gravity is too much. And I'll do anything you say. If you say it with your hands. And I'd be smart to walk away. But you're quicksand. This slope is treacherous. This path is reckless. This slope is treacherous. And I I I like it. I can't decide if it's a choice. Getting swept away. I hear the sound of my own voice. Asking you to stay. And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along. Forever going with the flow but you're friction. This slope is treacherous. This path is reckless. This slope is treacherous. I I I like it. Two headlights shine trough the sleepless night. And I will get you get you alone. Your name has echoed through my mind. And I just think you should think you should know. That nothing safe is worth the driving and i would. I'd follow you follow you home. I'll follow you follow you home. This hope is treacherous. This daydream is dangerous. This hope is treacherous. I I i I i I I i I. Two headlights shine trough the sleepless night. And I will get you get you alone. Your name has echoed through my mind. And I just think you should think you should know. That nothing safe is worth the driving and I would. follow you follow you home. I'll follow you follow you home. I'll follow you follow you home. I'll follow you follow you home. This hope is treacherous. This daydream is dangerous. This hope is treacherous. I I I I I I I I I. Two headlights shine through the sleepless night. And I will get you get you alone. Your name has echoed through my mind. And I just think you should think you should know. That nothing safe is worth the driving and I would. follow you follow you home.

2861,Tell me why did I fall in love with you?. Tell me why did I fall in love with you?. Tore me all to pieces cut me half in two. Tell me why did I fall in love with you?. Tell me why do my tears fall like rain?. Tell me why do my tears fall like rain?. Tore me all to pieces nothing else remains. Tell me why do my tears fall like rain?. Worry worry worry.

2863,I hate you I love you. Leave please don't go away. Can't decide if I like your face. Or if I wish it would stray. You're a child but you're malicious. You're sweet but don't remember my name. And heads you win and tails I'm lost. And love equals pain. I am drifting without an anchor. Through your ambigous region. A strange continent immune to all reason. And I'm flattered by your grey matter. Inside my skin I feel your tongue. Telling me I'm dirty and licking my bones. A surge against silence a knife across a plate. Makes the sound of need on hate. I am drifting without an anchor. Through your ambigous region. A strange continent immune to all reason. And I'm flattered by your grey matter. And I do not understand why a woman can't just love a man. You're amusing you're a real cool show. With your meat hooks and barbed wire carnival. You got glitter in your pocket. You got mothballs in your soul. From too many false teeth and greasy flash bulbs. I am drifting without an anchor. Through your ambigous region. A strange continent immune to all reason. And I'm flattered by your grey matter. I love you. I hate you.
2865,I'm convinced that you hate me. You like to see me cry. Its already a proven fact. And you wait and wait on me to die. Its all scary. I find it hard to confide. I will make you see it my way. You give. I take. You say. You want to be away from me. You break me. I've got a reason and I won't let go. You take me down. I've got a reason and I want to know. I'm convinced that you fucked me real good. You did (you did). But I wont let her go. I've got my reasons. And I'm not leavin. So I'll wait on you to die. Please take this time for me to be unforgiven. I give my life to you. I lay my life on the line for you. You break me. I've got a reason and I won't let go. You take me down. I've got a reason and I want to know. I got no reason. I got no reason. I got no reason. I got no reason. You break me. I've got a reason and I won't let go. You take me down. I've got a reason and I want to know. I got no reason. I got no reason. I got no reason. I got no reason
2867,There`ll be a storm one night. Then i will fly to you for shelter. Soaked in welcome rain. Falling to forbidden arms. Too breathless. Too helpless. Too restless to explain. Needing you.... There`ll be a storm one night. By you will find my place of hiding. We`ll watch the lights like children. Leave the fortress hand in hand. I`ll be thunder. You`ll be lightning. And we`ll collide on dry land. There`ll be a storm one night. And i will find no other rescue. Lost and far from home. Crying for some guiding light. Too reckless. Too helpless. To hungry to refrain. From needing you. There`ll be a storm one night. The wind will drive me to your castle. And you`ll ignite the fire. Just as if everything were planned. I`ll be thunder. You`ll be lightning. And we`ll collide on dry land. No betrayal. No denial no need to explain. We`ll collide

2869,These are the original ones:. See the way she walks down the street?. Watch the way she shuffles her feet.. May she holds her head up high as she goes walking bye.. And she throws her hands out so fast.. And she's not just one of the pack.. My baby always the one to try the things they've never done.. And just because of that they're saying:. She's a rebel and she'll never be any good.. She's a rebel cuz she never never does what she should.. And just because she doesn't do what everybody else does.. That's the reason why I can give her all my love..

2874,I've never met you yet never doubt you. I can't forget you. I've thought you out dear. I know your profile and I know the way you kiss. Just the thing I miss. On a night like this. If dreams are made of imagination. I'm not afraid of my own creation. With all my heart my heart is here for you to take. Why should I quake. I'm not awake. Isn't it romantic?. Music in the night a dream that can be heard.. Isn't it romantic?. Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.. I hear the breezes playing in the trees above. While all the world is saying you were meant for love.. Isn't it romantic. Merely to be young on such a night as this?. Isn't it romantic?. Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.. Sweet symbols in the moonlight. Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?. Isn't it romance?. [Instrumental]. I hear the breezes playing in the trees above. While all the world is saying you were meant for love.. Isn't it romantic. Merely to be young on such a night as this?. Isn't it romantic?. Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.. Sweet symbols in the moonlight. Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?. Isn't it romance?. Isn't it romance?. Isn't it romance?
2876,Do you remember the night in September. The two of us laid in the hay. Do you remember the day in December. And how we got carried away. CHORUS:. In you're in for a penny. You got to be in for a pound. Cos over and over. You played me that old fashioned sound. So look around. Did you discover that oo I'm a lover. When we took a tumble or two. Where you surprised when you tried me for size. You bit of more than you could chew. CHORUS.... Play the refrain. Play it and play it and play it again. ?[gee they got it bad]?. Do you remember the night I surrendered. You wanted to paint me in oils. Owh you are tender do you remember. The sleepers could hear me for miles. CHORUS...
2878,Is everything just right?. Don't want you thinking that I'm in a hurry. I won't stay afraid. I had this vision that has got me worried. Cause everyone wants someone. That's one cliché that's true. But since you I want no one. Unless that someone's you. It looks like you feels like you smiles like you. I want someone just like you through and through. I'm forever blue cause there's no one else like. I hope that you're not mad. You always said you want a man of passion. I'm not the hottest left no. There's more than liking physical attraction. You've got your special someone. But between me and you guess who. Was spending my whole life waiting for someone just you. It looks like you it feels like you it smiles like you. I need someone just like you love me true. I'm forever blue cause there's no one else like. I want you in my heart I see you in my dreams. I'm gonna make you mine as crazy as it seems.

You're so far. You're so far. You're so far
2879,A Cosmopolitan a Manhattan. Call me one. Pour a round for me and my friends. Cape Cod Sea Breeze Long Island Ice Teas. I won't go there or drink it if you paid me. When they come to waylay me. When they close in for the capture. I did it all. I did it all. For the love and the laughter. I did it all. I did it all. I did it all. Slept in late. Stayed up for days. Partied hard. Lived my twenties in haze. Smoked second-hand in crowded bars. With the A-list of B-list movie stars. When they come to arrest me. Pat me down and undress me. I'll confest without miranda. Strike a pose for the tabloid cameras. I did it all. I did it all. I did it all. I did it all. I didn't ask permission. I did it all. What kind of life. Is not an exhibition. I did it all. Crash and burn. And then you know you're living. I did it all. Some pain a few tears after. I did it all. To the last line of the final chapter. I did it all. I did it all. My heart is a wound that festers. Seduced my share in silk and polyester. Oh my great loves. And my few losses. I'll tell it all. When my little black book is published. When they come to interview me. For my made for TV movie. Say I'm the bitch who was a bastard. Who did it all for the love and laughter. I did it all. I did it all. I did it all
2880,You need protection from the physical art of conversation. Though the fist is mightier than the lip it adds the aggravation. Bridge and Chorus:. I got the password. I got persuasion. A proposition for invasion of your privacy. Give yourself away and find the fake in me. You'll never be a man. No matter how many foreign bodies you can take. You'll never be a man. When you're half a woman and you're half awake. (1) With a face full of tears and a chemical shake. (2) Under the table with a chemical shake. Given half a chance that I can take. Are you so superior are you in such pain. Are you made out of porcelain?. When they made you they broke the cast. Don't wanna be first I just want to last. You strike a profile on the low side of my imagination. My eyes climbed down to find the point of possible saturation. Bridge and Chorus.
2881,We'll get ya ya ya. We'll get ya ya ya. (I am Michael Caine). la la la la la la la la. He's walking where I'm afraid I don't know. I see the firemen jumping from the windows. There's panic and I hear somebody scream. He picks up useless paper and puts it in my pocket. I'm trying very hard to keep my fingers clean. I can't remember tell me what's his name. (My name is Michael Caine). And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep at home. And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep. The sun is laughing it's another broken morning. I see a shadow and call out to try and warn him. He didn't seem to hear just turned away. The quiet fellow follows. And points his finger straight at you. He had to sacrifice his pride yes. And throw it all away. (I am Micheal Caine). And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep at home. And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep. His days are numbered he walks round and round in circles. There is no place he can ever call his own. He seems to jump at the sound of the phone. Staring out the window there's nothing he can now do. All he wanted was to remain sane. He can't remer hisemb own name. (My name is Michael Caine). And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep at home. And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep. All I wanted was a word or photograph.
2882,You never said. You never said. You never said that it would be this hard. Love was meant to be forever. Now I never cease to discard. There's gotta be a better way for me. To say what's on my heart without leaving scars. So can you hear me?. When I call your name. CHORUS. When you fall apart. Am I the reason for your endless sorrow?. There's so much to be said. And with a broken heart. Your word can only go down but so low. Can you hear me?. When I call your name. When I call your name. Complicated situations are the makings of all that's wrong. And I've been standing in the river of deliverance way too long. There's gotta be a better way for me. To say what's on my heart without leaving scars. So can you hear me?. When I call your name. So can you hear me?. When I call your name. REPEAT CHORUS. You never said. You never said. You never said. You never said (WHEN I CALL YOUR NAME). You never said. You never said. You never said.

2884,You've been out all night. That's right. Underneath your black umbrella. Pales around the lights so bright. Like little angels in the sky. But they don't fly. You walk by. As if the street. I'm hoping that our eyes might meet. Your heart's too blind to see me. That's the price to be lonely. If you want really love. You think that you're tough enough. Take me on. Take me on. You wanna be turned around. You wanna touch higher ground. For the love that you've been missin'. You think that you're not strong. Take me on. In a small cafe. All day. Staring in a cup of coffee. Time just slips away. Smoking your last cigarette. With no regrets. I say hello. You look away. But there's a smile behind your face. There's something more between us. But your hearts too scared to stay. There's a face in every window. A light goes out. Someone's alone. When they wake up in the morning. To another day. Another chance gone. If you want really love. You think that you're tough enough. Take me on. Take me on. You wanna be turned around. You wanna touch higher ground. For the love that you've been missin'. You think that you're not strong. Take me on.

2893,Sat on my guilt I think about what I've done. A life won't be enough for making me forget. I am the black angel and my wings are broken. I am the white devil and I have lost my way. Suspended between these two worlds forever. I will stay waiting for my sentence but together. We'll pay. I am not the only one who has been wrong. But now I understand it. We are fierce monsters disguised as avid men. I dived in an abyss between good and evil. Suspended between these two worlds forever. I will stay waiting for my sentence but together. We'll pay. We can't put on a wretched mask to change. Who we are the blood on our hands shows us. That remember it forever. Suspended between these two worlds forever. I will stay waiting for my sentence but together we'll pay

2896,Look at the sad goodbyes. Every day's a killing time. Sun coming up outside. No men are born this time. Saturday's child stays home. Nothing to say so long. Well well well another day. Well well well another day. Grocery store ten bucks. Just making change for plastic cherries. Up in a tree a Jay Bird looking at me. No word. Everyone looks but can't see. We can't be ignored so easily. Well well well another day. Well well well another day. Soft within the wayward things. Like ecstasy the sound of trees. Most anything what a baby sees. Beautiful face all right. Many a place out of sight. Old woman there with red shoes. a million balloons all hues. Drive over hills forget your fear. Getting it out of second gear. Well well well another day. Well well well another day

2903,Living in poverty. searching for harmony. Chasing after dreams not yet real. An artist with no brush. a poet with no pen. Tried to tell the world what he did feel. Years of disappointment. rare moments of joy. Wonder how he endured the strife. He saw all the beauty. felt the sorrow and pain. Searchin for meaning to his life. Now that he's gone will his songs live on?. Will someone remember what he gave. Stars in the skies tears in your eyes. Ooo it made me feel so good inside. Came from Alabama. with a banjo on his knee. Spent some time in Nashville Tennessee. He sang some fine lines. sad songs of hard times. just for the people on the land. (Chorus)
2904,Fall down at your feet gary barlow mark owen howard donald. I've given all that I can give. Is only what I wanted. Holding you is easier to breathe. The more I lose the less it hurts.

Until it don’t hurt no more. Use my cuts and lacerations. Feed myself a new sensation. Woah. Woah. I take a ride on your high horse. The horse is blind. Use the force. A falcon flies in two straight lines. Red five standing by. Start a morning subspace station. It feels good the good vibration. Woah. Woah. I’m all that you know. Some lovely people.

2909,"F C9. The war was over and the spirit was broken. Dm9 Ebmaj9 Gm7. The hills were smokin' as the men withdrew. F. We stood on the cliffs. C/G A9. Oh and watched the ships. Bb Gm7. Slowly sinking to their rendezvous. F C9. They signed a treaty and our homes were taken. Dm9 Ebmaj9. Loved ones forsaken. Gm7. They didn't give a damn. F. Try'n' to raise a family. C/G A9.

And some stayed on to finish what they started. They never parted. They're just built that way. We had kin livin' south of the border. They're a little older and they've been around. They wrote a letter life is a whole lot better. So pull up your stakes children and come on down. Fifteen under zero when the day became a threat. My clothes were wet and I was drenched to the bone. Been out ice fishing too much repetition. Make a man wanna leave the only home he's known. Sailing out of the gulf headin' for Saint Pierre. Nothin' to declare. All we had was gone. Broke down along the coast. But what hurt the most. When the people there said. ""You better keep movin' on"". Everlasting summer filled with ill-content. This government had us walkin' in chains. This isn't my turf. This ain't my season. Can't think of one good reason to remain. I've worked in the sugar fields up from New Orleans. It was ever green up until the floods. You could call it an omen. Points ya where you're goin'. Set my compass north. I got winter in my blood. Acadian driftwood. Gypsy tail wind. They call my home the land of snow. Canadian cold front movin' in. What a way to ride. Ah what a way to go. F C7sus4 C7 Bb/D Gm7. Sais tu A-ca-di-e j'ai le mal du pays. [You know Acadia I long for the country (I am homesick)].

2910,(Joan Jett/Thommy Price). Things don't matter so much today. I really can't think too straight. Don't wanna make these tears go away. Cuz I believe that you could be my fate. Ya got me singin' a love song I'm so consumed so consumed. Thinking that you can do no wrong I'm so consumed so consumed. These tears are tears of happiness. I just need a little control. To hold it inside and hide my bliss. An' hope it will be enough to feed my hungry little soul yeah. Ya got me singin' a love song I'm so consumed so consumed. Thinking that you can do no wrong I'm so consumed so consumed. Never off the phone even when you're not home. I gotta hear your voice I got no choice. I'm hooked in tight but I feel no fright.

2911,Mud-covered cornfields starin' out my back door. The barn's leaning over now and that deer don't run no more. So much life before now that dream is gone. When the factory burned down I moved up to the city. The school we all went to is a memory that got bulldozed. And the good times froze when that door closed. Main Street's still there but the stores are all empty. The car lot where my daddy worked is dirt and stone. The only thing that comes through here. Is stormy weather. And it's raining.... It's raining in my heartland. We're packing them boxes for something better. Ran across my mom and dad's old love letters. And the photograph of this house that we're standin' in now. Let's stop by the church where we got married. Walk out back where your grandma's buried. And say goodbye one last time. Main Street's still there but the stores are all empty. The car lot where my daddy worked is dirt and stone. The only thing that comes through here. Is stormy weather. And it's raining.... It's raining in my heartland. Some dreams just stop growing where you plant them. You gotta count your blessings and be happy that you've had them. Let's grab a shovel baby - dig us a new life. Main Street's still there but the stores are all empty. The car lot where my daddy worked is dirt and stone. The only thing that comes through here. Is stormy weather. And it's raining.... It's raining in my heartland. Yeah it's rainin'. It's raining in my heartland. Oh my heartland. Yeah my heartland. It's rainin'...
2914,Did you say everything you could?. Do the things that you thought you would?. Did it ever occur to you that this could be your final day?. Did you go where you wanted to go?. Learn about what you wanted to know?. Did you ever really give something back instead of always taking it?. Did you find what your looking for?. Did you get your foot in the door?. Can you look at yourself and feel proud of all the things you've done?. Did you inspire the ones that you knew?. Make a difference to those who knew you?. Did you finally figure out what it is that makes us who we are today?. (Chorus). Don't waste another day. You know I know where you get one. Don't waste another day. To do anything you haven't done. (Did you?). Did you always give it your best?. (Did you?). Is there anything you regret?. (Did you?). If you could have another shot at it all would you do it just the same?. (Did you?). Was it all you thought it could be?. (Did you?). Are you the person you thought you would be?. (Did you?). Or did it feel like you were spinning your wheels instead of moving forward everday?. Chorus(x2). Did you?(x4). Chorus(x2). Did you?(x8)
2915,Sick tired and homeless. With no one here to sing for. Tired of being weightless. For all these looking good boys. You can always say my attic has its charm. You can always say you did no major harm. You can always say that summer had its charm. And that you did no major harm. Oh spare me if you please. Sick tired and sleepless. With no one else to shine for. Sick of all my distress. But i won't show i'm still poor. Symptoms are so deep. Something here's so wrong. Nothing is complete. Nowhere to belong. Symptoms are so deep. I think i'd better stay here on my own. So spare me if you please
2916,I come home in the morning light. My mother says when you're gonna live your life right. Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones. Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones. And girls they wanna have fun. That's all they really want. That's all they really want. That's all they really want. That's all they really want. The phone rings in the middle of the night. My father yells what you're gonna do with your life. Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one. But girls they wanna have fun. That's all they really want. That's all they really want. That's all they really want. That's all they really want. Some boys take a beautiful girl. And hide her away from the rest of the world. I wanna be the one to walk in the sun. I wanna be the one to walk in the sun. Oh girls they wanna have fun. That's all they really want. Some boys take a beautiful girl. And hide her away from the rest of the world. I wanna be the one to walk in the sun. I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
2918,Don't you know. They're talkin' about a revolution. It sounds like a whisper. Don't you know. They're talkin' about a revolution. It sounds like a whisper. While they're standing in the welfare lines. Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation. Wasting time in the unemployment lines. Sitting around waiting for a promotion. Don't you know. They're talkin' about a revolution. It sounds like a whisper. Poor people gonna rise up. And get their share. Poor people gonna rise up. And take what's theirs. Don't you know. You better run run run.... Oh I said you better. Run run run.... 'Cause finally the tables are starting to turn. Talkin' bout a revolution. Yes finally the tables are starting to turn. Talkin'about revolution

There's just one religion. One family of love. We suffer the children. As God cries above. And the giving not the taking. With hearts open wide. And it looks like we fall. And it burns like a flame. Any ground that I claim. So what is my life. If I don't believe. There is someone. To watch me follow my dreams. Take all my chances. Like those who dare. And what about our world.

2921,I have traveled many moonless nights. Cold and weary with a babe inside. And I wonder what I've done. Holy Father you have come. And chosen me now to carry your son. I am waiting in a silent prayer. I am frightened by the load I bear. In a world as cold as stone. Must I walk this path alone?. Be with me now be with me now. Breath of Heaven hold me together.

2975,I came along when he broke your heart. That's when you needed someone. To help forget about him. I gave you love with a brand new start. That's what you needed the most. To set your broken heart free. I know you cried and you felt blue. But when I could I gave strength to you. I'm waiting for the day when you can love again. I kissed your lips. And when your face looked sad. It made me think about him. And that you still loved him so. But you know that pretty soon. I made you feel glad. That you belonged to me. And love began to show. He hurt you then but that's all gone. I guess I'm saying you're the only one. I'm waiting for the day when you can love again. He hurt you then but that's all done. I guess I'm saying you're the only one. I'm waiting for the day when you can love again. You didn't think that I could sit around and let him work. You didn't think that I could sit around and let (watch) him take you. You didn't think that I could sit around and let him go. You didn't think that I could sit back and let you go. You didn't think....
2976,written by Warren Zevon 1982 Zevon Music (BMI). I'm going down to Memphis. Memphis Tennessee. I'm going down to Graceland. Thinking about the King. Remembering him sing. About those heavenly mansions. Jesus mentioned. Can't you just imagine. Digging up the King. Begging him to sing. About those heavenly mansions. Jesus mentioned. He went walking on the water. He went walking on the water. He went walking on the water. With his pills. Can't you just imagine. Digging up the King. Begging him to sing. About those heavenly mansions. Jesus mentioned.
2977,I was justified when I was five. Raising cane I spit in your eye. Times are changing now the poor get fat. But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back. Eat meat on Friday that's alright. Even like steak on a Saturday night. I can bitch the best at your social do's. I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue. I'm a bitch I'm a bitch. Oh the bitch is back. Stone cold sober as a matter of fact. I can bitch I can bitch. `Cause I'm better than you. It's the way that I move. The things that I do. I entertain by picking brains. Sell my soul by dropping names. I don't like those my God what's that
2980,The last time I saw you was down at the Greeks. There was whiskey on Sunday and tears on our cheeks. You sang me a song as pure as the breeze. Blowing up the road to Glenaveigh. I sat for a while at the cross at Finnoe. Where young lovers would meet when the flowers were in bloom. Heard the men coming home from the fair at Shinrone. Their hearts in Tipperary wherever they go. Take my hand and dry your tears babe. Take my hand forget your fears babe. There's no pain there's no more sorrow. They're all gone gone in the years babe. I sat for a while by the gap in the wall. Found a rusty tin can and an old hurley ball. Heard the cards being dealt and the rosary called. And a fiddle playing Sean Dun na nGall. And the next time I see you we'll be down at the Greeks. There'll be whiskey on Sunday and tears on our cheeks. For it's stupid to laugh and it's useless to bawl. About a rusty tin can and an old hurley ball. So I walked as day was dawning. Where small birds sang and leaves were falling. Where we once watched the row boats landing. By the broad majestic Shannon.
2984,To an honest man. I could give my body and my soul. With a practiced hand. You could lift me up and make me whole. To the one I love I give the key. And his eyes are stars that shine on me. And I smell the ocean in the dawn. And the bitter times have come and gone. In a gypsy cab. On the Brooklyn Bridge at sunrise. We are going home. And the lust is flirting in your eyes. To the one I love I give the key. And his eyes are stars that shine on me. And I smell the ocean in the dawn. And the bitter times have come and gone. Have come and gone. Have come and gone. Have come and gone. Lalala. In a hotel room. Up above the lights of Tompkins Square. While the music plays. I'm on my way to meet you there. To the one I love I give the key. And his eyes are stars that shine on me. And I'm back where I belong. And the bitter times have come and gone. Lalala. Ooh. To the one I love I give the key. And his eyes are stars that shine on me. Oh shine on me. Oh shine on me. Oh shine... on me. Oh shine on me. Oh shine on me. Shine on me. Oh shine on me
2987,Who wants to be right as rain. It's better. When something is wrong. You get excitement in your bones. And everything you do's a game. When night comes. And your all on your own. You can say I chose to be alone. Who want to be right as rain. It's harder when your on top. Cause when hard work. Don't pay off. And I'm tired. There ain't no room in my bed. As far as I'm concerned. So wipe that dirty smile off. We won't be making up. I've cried my heart out. And now. I've had enough of love. Who wants to be riding high. When you'll just crumble. Back on down. You give up everything you are. And even then you don't get far. They make believe that everything. Is exactly what it seems. But at least. When your at your worst. You know how to feel things. See when hard work. Don't pay off. And I'm tired. There ain't no room in my bed. As far as I'm concerned. So wipe that dirty smile off. We won't be making up. I've cried my heart out. And now. I've had enough of love. Go ahead and steal my heart. To make me cry again. Cause it will never hurt. As much as it did then. When we were both right. And no one had blame. But now I give up. On this endless game. Cause who wants. To be right as rain. It's better. When something is wrong. I get excitement. In your bones. Even thought. Everything's a strain. When night comes. And I'm all on my own. You should know. I chose to be alone. So who want to be. Right as rain. It's harder. When you're on top. Cause when hard work. Don't pay off. And I'm tired. There ain't no room in my bed. As far as I'm concerned. So wipe that dirty smile off. We won't be making up. I've cried my heart out. And now. I've had enough of love
2988,[Verse 1]. Sometimes it leaves me with fear. Never saw the horizon this near. Look to the left then to the right. I tuck you in and kiss you goodnight. [Verse 2]. See there is something I know. We are not whom we're told. We are more than we'll never know. [Chorus]. And we're living at the end of the world. Forget about all that you've heard. Living our dreams on the highway. It's just another day. No matter what they say or you've heard. We're living on top of the world. We're living our dreams on the highway. No matter what they say. It's just another day. [Verse 3]. I hear your heart beat in the night. You are like an echo of light. But in times when shallow runs deep. Your golden beauty goes cheap. Still there is something I know. Something yet to unfold. And we are more than we'll never know. [Chorus]. And we're living at the end of the world. Forget about all that you've heard. Living our dreams on the highway. It's just another day. No matter what they say or you've heard. We've made it to the top of the world. Building up speed on the highway. We've made it to the end. Living at the end of the world. [Outro]. Forget about all that you've heard. No matter what they say or you've heard. We've made it to the top of the world. Building up speed on the highway. We've made it to the end of the world
2989,On sticks and sand lost my money lost my hands. Blood on my brain too much salt in my veins. And I thought pain was clean. And I thought hearts were strong. But bones aren't sticks anymore. And a day is far too long. So many days never needing any grace. Live for kicks and danger there'd be beauty anyway. . And I thought pain was clean. And I thought hearts were strong. But bones aren't sticks anymore. And a day is far too long x3.
2991,"I hear your heartbeat but you're never there. Like a mirage you haunt me everywhere. All day long. I burn for you lonely in the night. I tried to live alone but I just can't get it right. Ya' know that this town's like a Painted Desert. Dead heat movin' in the city. I'm lost in a Painted Desert. In a Painted Desert without you. I've done some thinkin' now that you're not here. I know your reasons and they're still not clear. All I'm sure of is what I got to lose. I tried to be a better loser but it's just no use. Ya' know that this town's like a Painted Desert. Dead heat movin' in the city. I'm lost in a Painted Desert. In a Painted Desert without you. Walkin' in the sundown I search in vain. Waitin' on the wind that whispers out your name. Through concrete canyons echoing a world of other faces. No direction looks like home. Where is my oasis?. Ya' know that this town's like a Painted Desert. Dead heat movin' in the city. I'm lost in a Painted Desert. In a Painted Desert without you. In a Painted Desert without you. Where is my oasis?. From the album ""Tropico""."
2992,Freestyle. Freestyle... 45. Freestyle. I'm a country boy I got no soul. Don't sleep at night the world's growing old. I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones. I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones. Freestyle... 45. Freestyle. I'm a country boy I got no soul. Don't sleep at night the world's growing old. I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones. I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones.
2994,From The Morning. A day once dawned and it was beautiful. A day once dawned from the ground. Then the night she fell. And the air was beautiful. The night she fell all around.. So look see the days. The endless coloured ways. And go play the game that you learnt. From the morning.. And now we rise. And we are everywhere. And now we rise from the ground. And see she flies. And she is everywhere. See she flies all around. So look see the sights. The endless summer nights. And go play the game that you learnt. From the morning.. by Alice Petry
2995,(Seal). from the Clockers soundtrack. Brother. You can't lose that feeling. You can't give your life away.. Like a bird of freedom. You ain't got no dues to pay.. 'Cause they need you bad. For what they never had.. I want you to know. That it's alright to flow.. Yes it alright brother.. Yes it alright. No-nooo.. Let your love shine brighly. Let it burn right through my veins..

'Cause I wouldn't do this. Lord if I tried.. Why would I break this feeling?. When we're almost there.. Away from everywhere.. 'Cause not in a million. Lord if I tried.. Why can't I have you near me?. When we're almost there.. Away from everywhere.. Take to the skies and fly. Can't we have this feeling?. Take to the skies and fly.. Must we stop this feeling?.
3001,Music :Rudolf Schenker. Lyrics:Klaus Meine Herman Rarebell. Out in the streets. The dogs are on the run. The cats are all in heat. Out in the streets. Snakes are all around you. Dirty rats are on their way. They control you and they'll make you play. Out in the night. Glaring eyes in darkness. Tigers wanna fight. Out in the night. Spiders all around you. Spinning webs and make you pray. Tie you up and you can't get away. Bad boys running wild. If you don't play along with their games. Bad boys running wild. And you better get out of their way. Out in the streets. The dogs are on the run. The cats are all in heat. Out in the night. Spiders all around you. Spinning webs and make you pray. Tie you up and you can't get away. Bad boys running wild. If you don't play along with their games. Bad boys running wild. And you better get out of their way. Bad boys running wild. If you don't play along with their games. Bad boys running wild. And you better get out of their way. Get out of their way
3003,[Verse 1 - Timbaland]. I'm head over heels for someone (I). That I really can't deal with (deal with). I want to block her out my mind. But I really can't do it. I tell myself this the last time. I'ma let her do this to me. Whenever we do spend time. I realize that I can't get enough of you. [Bridge - Patrick Stump (Timbaland)]. (Let me say to you). Wipe that smile off your fucking face (Then I say to you). Wipe that smile off your face (Then I say to you). Wipe that smile off your fucking face (Then I say to you).

I wear scarves and hoods. 'Cause they're the only poker face that I got left. And everything I love about you is a mess. Smash the mirror and break the palm readers hand. (I) want to be better than I am. [Bridge - Patrick Stump (Timbaland)]. (Let me say to you). Wipe that smile off your fucking face (Then I say to you). Wipe that smile off your face (Then I say to you). Wipe that smile off your fucking face (Then I say to you). Wipe that smile off your face (Then I say to you). [Chorus - Patrick Stump].

3004,I don't go to school every monday. I've got my reason to sleep. Don't you tell me how I should be. I made up my mind 'bout the music. I made up my mind 'bout the style. I know that I'm stable and able to settle down. But I keep.... Refrão:. F-f-f-falling. Down with the sun. I can't give it up. The night is calling me like a drum. I keep on f-f-falling. This life is so full of temptation. And I want to keep it that way. I know myself I can handle the game. Made up my mind 'bout the future. Made up my mind 'bout the past. I know that I'm stable and able to hold on. Refrão. [falling]. I need a flame I need a spark. [falling]. Don't be afraid to open my heart. [falling]. I need a game I need a shock. [falling]. Don't be afraid my heart is unlocked. [falling falling falling falling]. F-f-falling. Refrão. [falling]. I need a flame I need a spark. [falling]. Don't be afraid to open my heart. [falling]. I need a game I need a shock. [falling]. Don't be afraid my heart is unlocked. [falling]. Made up my mind 'bout the music. [falling]. Made up my mind 'bout the style. [falling]. I know that I'm stable and able. [falling]. To settle down. F-f-falling.
3005,I'm just a simple man. Doing the best I can. Up there are campers in their bed. I hit this open road. It's like a rollercoaster. I don't know how to steer. Got money but I ain't got time. Tryin' to quit both but I dropped the line. Don't worry girl you're on my mind today. Had soul from the very start. Can you lead a revolution with a broken heart. And everyone asked if Ima be your king. Hell yeah uh huh uh huh. Hell yeah uh huh uh huh. I got fresh bread chops a couple of bucks. And I just don't give a f*ck. Hell yeah uh huh uh huh. Hell yeah uh huh uh huh. Well it ain't where ya from it's where ya at. And I'm never looking back. Our only witness is the empty sky. Late nights and early flights. He's gonna catch up to me. My only sleep is on the plane. Just out somewhere unknown. Speeding through dusty roads. We make our way through pouring rain. Got love but I ain't got time. Shine... it'll please my mind. Don't worry about me I'm fine my friend. I'll say uh huh. Had soul from the very start. Can you lead a revolution with a broken heart. Only one way to find out so sing. Hell yeah uh huh uh huh. Hell yeah uh huh uh huh. I got fresh bread chops a couple of bucks. And I just don't give a f*ck. Hell yeah uh huh uh huh. Hell yeah uh huh uh huh. Well it ain't where ya from it's where ya at. And I'm never looking back now. Our only witness is the empty sky. Only bags I got are under my eyes. Guess I gotta look on the bright side. On the pool side sipping Mai Thais. Pelegrino out in Reno sunset skylines. Spend a week in the Palm Spring Army. Got a car with no roof to see the palm trees. Couple pretty girls all they wanna do is party. Another morning I'm walking 'round like a f*cking zombie. So what hurting only gets better. Only need a couple friends and good weather. Roof top red cups better last forever. Let the good times roll like I landed on something. Headcrack that's me at the table. At the Tropicano with the limo out waiting. Living every day like I'm on vacation. And if you wanna ride start singing. Hell yeah uh huh uh huh. Hell yeah uh huh uh huh. I got fresh bread chops a couple of bucks. And I just don't give a f*ck. Hell yeah uh huh uh huh. Hell yeah uh huh uh huh. Well it ain't where ya from it's where ya at. And I'm never looking back now. Our only witness is the empty sky. Let me sing it again now. Our only witness is the empty sky
3007,When I know I'm all alone. I say your name slowly. and I know that I'm alone. But I carry you. Does it feel good? Like the memory?. When you try some history. It's a dream to come around. The rule doesn't bend. Because the taste doesn't taste the same again. It's easy feeling righteous when removed. All you'll get is what you want to hear. It hurts because it should. How else am I to make it clear?. I could never be the one that you want. Don't ask. Well here's to living in the moment. Cause it passed. Maybe a lie is what I need sometimes. You told the most the best of anyone. You said to keep me in your pocket. So I carried you. You better choose your words carefully. Because I'm not your anything. Going to stay here in my place and you'll stay in yours. Because you're only good as what you're good for. I pace around the room to spend the time. Waiting while the burning pictures fade. It's one thing to make your mind. And another to say its name. I could never be the one that you want. Don't ask. Well here's to living in the moment. Cause it passed it passed. I'm still carrying a little hope. That maybe things could be different now. Is that so wrong?. Would I see you tonight at a place we'd go?. Could going through the motions lead to real emotion?. I wanna make things right before time runs out. It was like you said the taste don't taste like it should. Roll down the windows let the cold air come in. Slap my face just to feel you somehow again. I could never be the one that you want. Don't ask. Well here's to living in the moment. Because it passed
3008,What good can drinkin' do what good can drinkin' do?. Lord I drink all night. but the next day I still feel blue.. There's a glass on the table. they say it's gonna ease all my pain. And there's a glass on the table. they say it's gonna ease all my pain.. But I drink it down an' the next day I feel the same.. Gimme whiskey gimme bourbon give me gin.. Oh gimme whiskey give me bourbon gimme gin.. 'Cause it don't matter what I'm drinkin' Lord. as long as it drown this sorrow I'm in.. I start drinking Friday I start drinking Friday night.. Lord I start drinking Friday start drinking Friday night.. But then I wake up on Sunday. child there ain't nothin' that's right.. My man he left me child he left me here.. Yeah my good man left me. went away and left me here.. Lord I'm feelin' lowdown. just give me another glass of beer.. What good can drinkin' do what good can drinkin' do ?. Well I drink all night. but the next day I still feel blue!!!
3009,We strolled through fields all wet with rain. And back along the lane again. There in the sunshine. In the sweet summertime. The way that young lovers do. I kissed you on the lips once more. And we said goodbye just adoring the nighttime. Yeah that's the right time. To feel the way that young lovers do. Then we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way that we were. and the way that we were meant to be. Then we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way that I was for you. and you were for me. And then we danced the night away. And turned to each other say 'I love you I love you'. The way that young lovers do. Do do do do.... Then we sat on our star and dreamed of the way that we were and the way. that we wanted to be. Then we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way that I was for you. and you were for me. I went on to dance the night away. And turned to each other say 'I love you baby I love you'. The way that young lovers do lovers do lovers do. Do do do do.....
3011,(M. Jagger/K. Richards). Hold on to your head. Hold on to your hat. You're screaming down the alley. And never coming back. Get out of my bod. Get out of the sack. Don't give me no lip. Don't give me no crap. No way. Get out the madhouse. Tear it all down. Get out the madhouse. Burn it to the ground. Got to got to get out. Get out of my face. Get out of my shack.

3012,For those under the clouds. Staring up in awesome wonder. As tears come slowly down. I'm reaching up a needful hand. [Chorus:]. You are my eyes when I cannot see. You are my voice see sing through me. You are my strength in weakness be. To find that I could fall. And still your grace surrounds pursuing. To freely stumble down. I feel your hands around my heart. [Chorus]. You are my strength my voice my eyes. I lift up needful hands. You are my strength my voice my eyes. I lift up needful hands. [Chorus]
3015,I’m a preacher sweating in the pew. For the salvation I’m bringing you. I’m a salesman I’m selling you hooks and plans. And myself for making demands. When I’m home alone I just can’t stop myself. And you pull my hips so close lying goes with the truth. Signing off I’m alright in bed but I’m better with a pen. The kid was alright but it went to his head. I am god’s gift but why would he bless me with. Such wit without a conscience equipped. I’m addicted to the way I feel when I think of you woah. It's too much green to feel blue. When I’m home alone I just can’t stop myself. And you pull my hips so close lying goes with the truth. Signing off I’m alright in bed but I’m better with a pen. The kid was alright but it went to his head. When I’m home alone I just can’t stop myself. And you pull my hips so close lying goes with the truth. Signing off I’m alright in bed but I’m better with a pen. I’m alright in bed but I’m better with a pen. I’m alright in bed but I’m better with a pen. The kid was alright but it went to his head
3018,If you put your arms around me. Could it change the way i feel?. I guess I let myself believe. That the outside might just bleed its way in. Maybe stir the sleeping past. Lying under glass. Waiting for the kiss. That breaks this awful spell. Pull me out... of this lonely cell. Close my eyes and hold my heart. Cover me and make me something. Change this something normal. Cnto something beautiful. What I get from my reflection. Isn't what I thought i'd see.. Give me reason to believe. You'd never keep me incomplete. Will you untie this loss of mine?. It easily defines me. Do you see it on my face?. That all i can think about is how long. I've been waiting to feel you move me.. Close my eyes and hold my heart. Cover me and make me something. Change this something normal. Into something beautiful. Into something beautiful. Into something beautiful. And I'm still fighting for the word. To break these chains. And I still pray when I look in your eyes. You'd stare right back down. Into something beautiful. So close my eyes and hold my heart. Cover me and make me something. Change this something normal. Into something beautiful. Into something beautiful. Into something beautiful.

3028,Well ever since you were a little girl. You set the rules in your little world. But girls grow up and throw their toys away. You're a big girl now but you still wanna play. (Girl we're living). You dress them up the way you want to. (Girl we're living). You make them do just what you want them to do. (Girl we're living). Once I thought we had a love that was true. But I'm just another doll in your dollhouse to you. We're living in a dollhouse. We're living in a dollhouse. Girl we're living in a dollhouse. You may feel safe and sound. But your dollhouse girl is falling down. It's all been neatly arranged in your mind. Every detail fits your own design. Every room is perfectly in place. But I can see the sadness baby on your face. You had a plan and darling like a child. You thought it's down to fashion down to style. But your little dreamhouse is runnin' wild. Before your very eyes we're shrinking down to size. We're living in a dollhouse. We're living in a dollhouse. Girl we're living in a dollhouse. We may feel safe and sound. But our dollhouse girl is falling down. Everything's as you dreamed it would be. But there's something wrong that you can't see. Room by room you keep looking for some little flaw. A crack somewhere in your dollhouse wall. Something girl that will explain away. The hurt you feel darling when we play. Your little dolls they got a grip on you. Until you're just another doll in your dollhouse too. We're living in a dollhouse. Girl we're living in a dollhouse. Oh we're living in a dollhouse. We may feel safe and sound. But our dollhouse girl is falling down. Oh we're living in a dollhouse. Girl we're living in a dollhouse. Yeah we're living in a dollhouse.
3029,Josephine where can you be now?. Again the sun is rising on my troubled heart. Don't deny you know you and I. Are the making of what fate. Just can't pull apart. My sweet Josephine. Won't you come and marry me?. I got every kind of love. That you would ever need. Dying here on bended knees. Sheets of rain. Cold and gray. Run down the page. Just about your name. With just the weight. Of your silent smile. Crashing all around me. While I screamed it out loud. My sweet Josephine. Won't you come and marry me?. I got every kind of love. That you would ever need. Dying here on bended knees. Like a raven in a cage. Blood on my birth. Just won't wash away. Like a stitched together doll. My feet to the flame. As I follow the blame. For someone else's pain. For someone else's pain. Rivers of black ink flood. A tapestry of flesh and blood around my frame. A living shrine just for you of human mind. Golden pen upon your hand. Leave this endless winter behind. My sweet josephine. Won't you come and marry me?. I got every single kind of love. That you would ever need. Dying here on bended knees. Dying here on bended knees. Dying here on bended knees. My Josephine

3032,You ought to go north somebody told us. Cause the air is filled with gold dust. And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands. Now I don't recall who said it. But we'd lived so long on credit. So we headed out to find our promised land. Just poor Smoky Mountain farm folk. With nothing more than high hopes. As we hitched our station wagon to a star. But our dreams all fell in on us. Cause there was no land of promise. Though it's a stuggle keepin' sight of who you are. Oh and these northern nights are dreary. And my southern heart is weary. As I wonder how the old folks are back home. But I know that they all love me. And I know they thinking of me. Smoky Mountain memories keep me strong. You know I've been thinkin' a whole lot lately. About what's been and what awaits me. It takes all I've got to give what life demands. You go insane if you give in to it. Life's a mill and I've been through it. I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands. Oh and these northern nights they're dreary. And my southern eyes are teary. As I wonder how the old folks are back home. But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus. He'll love and guide and lead us. Smoky Mountain memories keep me strong. I'll keep looking to the father. Keep my head above the water. Smoky Mountains memories keep me strong

You hurt me in the deepest way. I'm crippled inside. I took your evil skin away. It's all cut and dried. I saw you tonight and carefully took your hand. With some smears on my cheeks. I knew that you would understand. In my eyes. Blood drops look like roses on white lace. They won't wash away. In my mind they're roses on white lace. Straight from the heart. So dead upon the bed still searching for your head. They're never gonna find your face. It's hidden away. I found a very special place where you used to play. In my own way I lovingly kiss the bride. With your ring in your hand. Your eyes and your mouth open wide. In my eyes. Blood drops look like roses on white lace. They won't wash away. In my mind they're roses on white lace. Straight from the heart. Blood drops look like roses on white lace. Crimson and sweet stained on the sheet. Roses on white lace pretty in red dripping and wet. Roses on white lace spilled on the walls dark in the hall.

3096,I was standing on a wave then I made the drop. I was lying in a cave in the solid rock. I was feeling pretty brave 'til the lights went off. Sleep by no means comes too soon. In a valley lit by the moon. We left a little dust on his Persian rug. We gathered up our clothes got the washing done. In a long forgotten place who'll be the first to run?. I was floating on a wave then I made the drop. I was climbing up the walls. Waiting for the band to start. You can say the magic words. I've got my senses on. and this is the only place that I always run from.
3097,Stand at the window. Pull back the lace. I feel the night wind on my face. All that I long for - all that I crave. Am I master Am I slave?. The night's so still. I feel the lovers out in the hills. The breathing of young girls lying in bed. Visions of love in their heads. Desire walks on. Desire walks on. A beautiful boy gazed in a pool. His eyes looking back like jewels. The call of the mirror - too strong to resist. The call of the water - the call of a kiss. Desire walks on. Desire walks on. It wants to be held - possessed. It wants consummation. It moves on obsessed. Blodstream through pipes. Singing in the wires. Heat - motion - control. Desire walks on. Stand at the window. The world is so still. Calling you back by force of will. Where did you go?. I don't know why. Too much longing inside. You wrapped me in nighttime sexual disguise. I was the love in your eyes. You took me over. My innocence cracked. You own my passion. I want you back. Desire walks on.

3101,This is to be our final transmission. The rebels have defeated our illustrious armies. They have damaged our intention of ugly. and defiant malevolance. All that we love and care for will. sink into the abyss of a new dark age. made more sinister and perhaps more protracted. by the light of perverted science and rebellion. The whole root and heavy core will perish and starve in captivity. You will never win your freedom. You cannot escape... F. E. A. R

And it's hare to let go. And it's hard not to show. The fumbling beat of a heart. Repeating itself in the dark. Still laugh sill dream. And bursting apart at the seam. Of whatever i hoped it would be. Little bird on the wire. Little bird from the fire. I'm circling back where you are. Repeating no matter how far. Then time speaks. Through the shuffling feet. And the cold heat. And the soul. Can't breath can't sleep. And words are too big for my head. Some words they should never be said. And it's hard to let go. And it's hard not to show. The fumbling beat of a heart. Repeating itself in the dark. Oo and heart is what you can't give. But you just did don't you know.... Can't breath can't sleep. And words are too big for my head. Some words they should never be said. And it's hard to let go....
3164,As he raises his hand you begin to understand. That no love is worth the hate that you feel. Now you're running out of pain. And all these feelings feel the same. So you close your eyes and wish it all away. And I lie awake and I try to say. Anything I know just to ease your pain. But you hide away where no one can see. And it's only you that can set you free. Now the time has come again. So you reach deep down within. To find the strength that you have buried there. As you turn to walk away you can still hear him say. You'll never make it in this world alone. You try to fight (you try to fight). You hide the pain (you hide the pain). You walk away (You walk away). Never again!

You wake up and you don't notice. Which way the wind is blowing. Don't fade. Don't fade on me. You were the one who made things different. You were the one who took me in. You were the one thing I could count on. Above all you were my friend. Don't fade. Don't fade on me. Well your clothes hang on a wire. And the sun is overhead. But today you are too weary. To even leave your bed. Was it love that took you under?. Or did you know too much?. Was it something you could picture?. But never could quite touch?. Don't fade. Don't fade on me

3210,Slowly my life begins to fade. I try to crawl away. But it's hard when you've been stabbed in the back. It's hard when the world has turned black. I can't get away from this. Can't get away from this. Can't crawl away from this. Gently I begin to break. I just want to wake. Just like all that I have ever been. I'm tired of living in such a sin. I can't get away from this. Can't get away from this. Can't crawl away from this. Come pretty seed suffer like me. With me. Come with me bleed with me. With me. Never ever speak a word again for me. Never ever speak a word again for me. Come pretty fruit suffer like you. With you. Gone with you bleed with you. With you. I hope that I'll someday see you again lover. I hope that I'll someday see you again lover. Hope that someday. See you again...
3211,Just a day just an ordinary day. Just tryin' to get by. Just a boy just an ordinary boy but. He was looking to the sky and. As he asked if I would come along. I started to realize that everyday he finds just what he's lookin' for. Like a shooting star he shines and he said. Take my hand live while you can. Don't you feel your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand. And as he spoke he spoke ordinary words. Though they did not feel. For I felt what I had not felt before. And you'd swear those words could heal and. As I looked up into those eyes his vision borrows mine. And I know he's no stranger. For I feel I've held him for all of time and he said. Take my hand live while you can. Don't you feel your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand. Please come with me see what I see. Touch the stars for time will not flee. Time will not flee can't you see. Just a dream just an ordinary dream. As I wake in bed. And that boy that ordinary boy. Was it all in my head?. Didn't he ask if I would come along. It all seemed so real but as I looked to the door. I saw that boy standing there with a deal and he said. Take my hand live while you can. Don't you feel your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand. Just a day just an ordinary day. Just tryin' to get by. Just a boy just an ordinary boy but. He was looking to the sky

I got nothing to lose at all. I'm gonna do it my way. Take a chance before I fall. A chance before I fall!. You can hang in a left or hang in a right. The choice it is yours to do as you might. The road is open wide to place your bidding. Now wherever you turn wherever you go. If you get it wrong at least you can know. There's miles and miles to put it back together!.

Candy stuck in children's hair everywhere I go. In the night time.. Crystals sparkles in the grass I polish them with thought.. On my lash there in my eye a star of light is caught..

3226,I'm not afraid of anything in this world. There's nothing you can throw at me. that I haven't already heard. I'm just trying to find a decent melody. A song that I can sing in my own company. I never thought you were a fool. But darling look at you (ohhh). You've got stand up straight carry your own weight. These tears are going nowhere baby. You've got to get yourself together. You've got stuck in a moment. and now you can't get out of it. Don't say that later will be better. now you're stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it. I will not forsake the colours that you bring. But the nights you filled with fireworks. They left you with nothing. I am still enchanted by the light you've brought to me. I listen through your ears and through your eyes I can see. And you are such a fool. To worry like you do (ohhh). I know it's tough and you can never get enough. Of what you don't really need now... my oh my. You've got to get yourself together. You've got stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it. Oh love look at you now. You've got yourself stuck in a moment. and you can't get out of it. I was unconscious half asleep. The water is warm till you discover how deep.... I wasn't jumping... for me it was a fall. It's a long way down to nothing at all. You've got to get yourself together. You've got stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it. Don't say that later will be better now. You're stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it. And if the night runs over. And if the day won't last. And if our way should falter. Along the stony pass. And if the night runs over. And if the day won't last. And if your way should falter. Along the stony pass. It's just a moment. This time will pass

But if you can't control yourself. Then let's just keep good friends.. Let's make out in the back of your car.. Let's go driving and tooling around.. We could always get lost in a crowd.. Are you ready to get deep down?. Woo-hoo!. Woo-hoo!. Now there's something you should know about. I'm chronically depressed.. I internalize my hatred and sacrifice myself.. Now I am busy Saturday. But I am free tonight. And I might have to sort you out. If you don't do it right.. Let's make out in the back of your car.. Let's go driving and tooling around.. We could always get lost in a crowd.. Are you ready to get deep down?. Woo-hoo!. Woo-hoo!. Get busy with the fizzy baby.. Get busy with the fizzy baby.. Get busy with the fizzy baby..

Brother where are you?. They said you came this way. (Looking for a soul brother all around him). (Looking for a soul brother all around him). The eyes of the people who passed him by.

3231,She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house. She played a good game of darts and the men slapped her back. And never took her out. She wore a trenchcoat khaki. Her hobnail boots were full of holes. She's got medals. Her mother called her Mary but she changed her name to Tommy she's a one oh. She went and joined the army passed the medical. Don't ask me how it's done. They sent her to the front line. Fighting for her country's name. She's got medals. She got very tired of picking up girls. Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls. Then the enemy dropped a bomb. Survivors there were none. People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed. You can see her ghost but that's a lie because the naughty woman isn't dead. She deserted on the previous morning. Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green. Called herself Eileen. Came to London town. Now she's settled down.

G C. Let the night fall. G C. Let the night fall. G C. Let it fall on me. G. Let it fall on me. I am the owl who calls upon the night. I am the eyes that abandon the light. When no one's there and the dogs bark. I'm the voice howling in the dark. --chorus--. I am the owl old and wise. The lord of wood with silent eyes. The cock screams at the first spark of dawn. That's my cue and I'll be moving on and on.

You criticize the flow and isolate the box.. I always knew you were a scientist at heart.. I always knew you were.. Last train to Norwich.... Schrodinger's cat is dead to the world..

For that girl I left behind. And oh what I'd give if I could be there tonight. With the sweetheart who's waitin' for me. In the blue Canadian Rockies. Spring is silent through the trees.

And the one I love to see.
3240,Last time I was here it was raining. It ain’t raining anymore. Streets were drowning and the water’s laming. All the ruins washed ashore. Now I am here just looking through the rubble. Try to find out who we were. Last time I was here it was raining. It ain’t raining anymore. Last time I was here you were waiting. You’re not waiting anymore. The window’s broke and the smoke’s escaping. The books scattered across the floor. And the churchbells are ringing through the sirens. Your coat was full of bulletholes. Last time I was here you were waiting. You’re not waiting anymore. So may the wind blow. May the moonlight know your name. So let the needle pull the record ‘round. To the walls came in. You and I we’re out there dancing. In the dirty rain. Last time I was here it was raining. Like you have never seen it rain. And your eyes were filled with terror. And tears from the gasoline. As the stars exloding with gunfire. I saw you smiling just before. Last time I was here you were crying. You ain’t crying anymore. So let the moon now. May the moonlight know your name. So let the needle pull the record ‘round. To the walls came in. You and I we’re out there dancing. In the dirty rain. The dirty rain

Now there is nothing left that can numb me. Do you love me or do I run. Why don't you ask me to stay?. Ask me to stay. Looked so surprised when she said to me. Can you move the mountain then we can both see. She fell in my arms then I melted away. She said why don't you ask me ask me to stay?. Ooh we caught the moon from the sky.

3296,Don't fear mere words cuz if it takes a word ruin ya. You should have already hard you're finished through and soon ya. See that stifling sentences is so much more suspicious. Much worse could come of that so much more delicious. To the dastardly basturdly plans of little mice and men. Ugly rears its head and speaks from now and then. People love to disagree so avoid the endless bout make no attempt. To try and suss the stupid out. But of the racist institutions simple minds belong. Not happy just being human no wish to get along. Little people need exclusions sucker groups to throng. It makes them feel special it makes them feel strong. Now I got a click but it's more like a family. Not an ethnic trip more like an ethic see. I write the rhyme today tell it to you later. Whether were coming in wack or what it's a waste to be a hater. Graffiti bombs-from the palms-love is so strong. Can't be stopped too long. For the night it will come. Shaped in the form of Mars that stone afar. Ghetto cool Oh well. Now you feel the spell. The color rocks the bell. The king of swing rise to the top. The thythm possessed in ya and it don't stop. The mise is broken The demon locin'. Dropping the bomb and all that is left is the smokin'. Cloakin' chokin; the lyrics are spoken. Infrared vision scopin' condition. Now breakin' 'em all to pieces like a sly rap bandit. Witha fly Lu-Kang kick in Mortal Combat and I land it. So get your own back when I jam it cold and. Hearing about you rhyme style been outmoded. The dopest flow upon the planet. Dope is the word the bro throw up on the down low goddammit. You juice your fucking friends like Dracula. But when we kick you out you're just brokula. You left a big surprise from Pacific Bell. Called all your relatives and your friends in Hell. Now let me tell you something you fucking piece of shit. You'll never have no money now tell me was it worth it?. You leave a trail of lies that's why you keep moving. We won't come after you we'd only end up provin. In the end revenge send ends to the defendant. I know that statement's true I wear it like a pendant. I know you'll hear this song so I think it's funny. The name is theif or trust and money.. Like Captain Picard we come hard in light years. Our star has long bust but now reappears. In your sky at night rising and immense. Yes you see ourselves in the shine of it. And so passing under the dome of the great sky. Beware we are the stars holmes that you ruled by. Where death reborn into the world is a gift. So the future with no voice of its own will uplift. All is gone. All is calm y'all. Set wrecked in L.A.. In the Wetlands of New York. Atlanta and Phoenix. Portland Lincoln and N.O..
3298,"Baby I wanna tell you something. Just a word and it's no lie. I got so much feeling in side of me. Baby our love will last forever. Through the changes of the heart.

Coz our love is for all time. Baby I may be gone tomorrow. But I'm here with you tonight. I'll be holding you 'till morning light. And baby I'm gonna watch you wake up.

3304,"Once there was a fellow and his name was Buzz. He was just a rookie cop just a baby Buzz. He patroled the Sunset Strip in the land of the free and the home of the hip. He protected you and me from evil women like poor Alice D. Alice was the girl that all the hippies dread. And they called her sweet Alice the head. Alice it was plain to see was full of pot and STD. She'd attract a great big crowd because her inner piece was much too loud. Good Buzz did the thing that all the good Buzz must. Stuck his gun in Alice's back and said ""This is a Buzz"". Shone the flashlight in her eyes she began to hypnotise. Buzz said ""What a wild sensation guess this must be hallucination"". Love is so sensational when you fall in love with eyes dilational. Now they're taking pills in shops Buzz is not afraid of what. Buzz and Alice D have shown the way of where the Buzz might be some day. Buzz is still a cop of course he's the pusher on the porch."

3316,No equation. to explain the division of the senses. No sound to reflect. the radiance of time. In the beginningest dream. Halls of disorder. Where we are swept to encircle dawn. Strapped in a low car. Racing thru silence. Trumpeting bliss. You could kiss the world. goodbye. Standing outside the courthouse. in the rain. Seemed like a lost soul. from the chapel of dreams. With a handful of images. Faces of children. Phases of the moon. One little thing you get wrong. changes the dimensions. Streets swept memory. Diffused and lost. Like a prayer in the sun. Sometimes you can't tell. whether you're waking up. or going to sleep. Spiralling. Unnumbered streets. All the games cannot be yours. All the sights the treasures of the eye. Does the divided soul remain the same?. No equation to explain. Destiny's hand. Moved by love. Drawn by the whispering shadows. Into the mathematics.
3319,Don't you want to get to know me well. Don't lie to me cause I can always tell. When you're feeling strange. I know you. There's no point in banging any blame. The mind is powerful it loves to play. Games that don't come with any rules. I'm mad about you. Overwhelmed. I'm feeling like I never thought I could. I'm mad about you. Overwhelmed. Every line does me good. I know it's not the way we planned. I love it when yo take my hand. And kiss me and then just hold still. You fill me with all your energy. Your poisons antidotes and sympathies. In a place that no one could ever fill. I'm mad about you. Overwhelmed. I'm feeling like I never thought I could. I'm mad about you. Overwhelmed. Every line does me good. An you won't be alone when you sleep tonight. Cause I worry oh I'm worrying too. But the ocean sends waves to the beach so we'll play. And to clean all the water up too. I'm mad about you. Overwhelmed. I'm feeling like I never thought I would. I'm mad about you. Overwhelmed. Every line does me good. Every line on you face does me good

3328,I picture us together. Framed in gold leaf. On the mantle with the others. One big happy family. But that snapshot can't be found. And I don't trust my memory. But it's alright it's alright. For a dream. I imagine we are gathered. But this time not dressed in black. There's laughing and smiling. Not stabbing in the back. But it's too good to be true. And too bad I still recall the screams. [Chorus]. I keep half the picture. Mostly in my mind. Mama dressed in white. Ripped when she held your hand. Showing no signs of age. Just slightly frayed along the seam. [Chorus]. It's alright. All that I can claim. It's alright. And it will have to do. It's alright. Better than the pain. It's alright. Better than the truth. It's alright. Alright for a dream. It's alright. Better than fate and the great scheme. It's alright. It's alright. For christmas and for New Year. I wish and I resolve. But I'm disappointed by myself. Jesus and Santa Claus. I want to believe. She's been saved. And he's be redeemed. And it's alright it's alright. For a dream

3336,Stick 'em up baby reach for the sky. Here's somethin' you might like to try. I know a place that's far from here. where the squares they won't come near. How far?. How far?. How far baby?. How far can too far go?. You'll be the queen of the tractor pull. In you training gear you'll break all the rules. I like it tough and I don't talk my kicks. If I had a hammer I'd show you some tricks. How far?. How far?. How far baby?. How far can too far go?. Giddyup baby . . ooh la la. Giddyup baby . . sha la la la la. I know a place that's far from here. where the squares they won't come near. A smell of honey . . a swallow of brine. Let's whoop it up have a real bad time. How far?. How far?. How far baby?. How far can too far go?.
3337,We grew up fast and no one seemed to notice.. We grew up fast and we grew up alone.. Mom and Dad were never what we wanted.. We grew up fast and we grew up alone.. We grew up alone.. Well you know who I am so don't treat me like I'm someone else.. Well you know what I am so don't treat me like I'm someone else.. You never act like that with no one else.. We grew up mad when lies were just a fact of life.. We grew up mad 'cause we've never had a home.. We faced the past and forgave the revolution.. We grew up smashed and we grew up alone.. We grew up alone.. Hey my brother I got no fight with you I just can't ride down.. Hey my brother I got no fight with you I just can't ride down.. No I just can't ride down.. I just can't ride down.. Well you know who I am so don't treat me like I'm someone else.. Well you know what I am so don't act like I'm somethin' else.. Well you know who I am so don't treat me like I'm someone else..

3339,I thought/ you'd be out of my mind. And I'd finally found a way to learn to live without you. I thought it was just a matter of time. Till I had a hundred reasons not to think about you. But it's just not so. And after all this time I still can't let go. I've still got your face. Painted on my heart. Scrawled upon my soul. Etched upon my memory baby. And I've got your kiss. Still burning on my lips. The touch of my fingertips. This love so deep inside of me baby. I've tried/ everything that I can. To get my heart to forget you. But it just can't seem to. I guess it's just no use. In every part of me. Is still a part of you. And I've still got your face. Painted on my heart. Scrawled upon my soul. Etched upon my memory baby. I've got your kiss. Still burning on my lips. The touch of her fingertips. This love so deep inside of me baby. I've still got your face. Painted on my heart. Painted on my heart. Painted on my heart oh baby. Something in your eyes keeps haunting me. I'm trying to escape you. And I know there ain't no way to. To chase you from my mind. I've still got your face. Painted on my heart. Scrawled upon my soul. Etched upon my memory baby. I've got your kiss. Still burning on my lips. The touch of my fingertips. This love so deep inside of me baby. I've still got your face. I've still got your face. Painted on my heart. Painted on my heart
3340,by Chester Burnett. One summer day she went away;. Gone and left me she's gone to stay.. She's gone but I don't worry:. I'm sitting on top of the world.. All the summer worked all this fall.. Had to take Christmas in my overalls.. She's gone but I don't worry:. I'm sitting on top of the world.. Going down to the freight yard gonna catch me a freight train.. Going to leave this town; worked and got to home.. She's gone but I don't worry:. I'm sitting on top of the world..
3341,Across the town on the other hill. your lights glow from a different world.. You always found a place to hide - nails and cross to lay beside;. with all the ghosts that we denied.. Now in rippled arcs across the sky the great white birds of winter fly;. and the wheel turns and people change - scattered ashes to the wind.. And there's no pain there's no pain there's no pain. A dry river in the blazing sun . .. Your parched face and your callused hands. Behind us lie the arid lands. To say too much - well it was not our way. and in the end there wasn't much to say;. the scars are healed now anyway. and there's no pain. . a dry river in the blazing sun . .. And Abraham rose took his only son and knife and tinder. in his hand and setting out across the desert and up into. the scrubland hills he bound the boy Isaac to the stone. raised the blade and waited for the miracle.. But the wind blows silent across the hills across the dead and the empty hills. dead like the god that never came. like your face the day that you turned away..
3342,(Ready ready?). I heard a knock at the door. It's mama calling my name. She said get up off the floor. I heard her going insane. She said your friend's on the phone. I said to her can it wait?. But then she started to moan. No time cos I'm running late. x2. Nobody's ever gonna. I do just what I wanna. I'm bad and I'm not sorry. And you will never stop me…. x2. No you will never stop me. x2. Nobody's ever gonna. x8
3343,I&acute;m looking up x5. But when I look at you I&acute;m looking down.. I&acute;m looking up. at a world I left I&acute;m looking down.. I&acute;m looking up. at the sky straight ahead. there&acute;s the moon the sun&acute;s right behind you;. If you stare it can blind you.. And when you see them both together. chances are I&acute;m gonna find you looking up.. (Sterling/Kesterson).
3344,I should've done something again. I did nothing watch us separate. What should I do now. run and chase you down. I can't hesitate. Cause all I wanted to say was something real. All I want you to know is how I feel. All I wanted to give was my heart. but I'm stuck here at the start. It's on the tip of my tongue but I'm still afraid. Sometimes the only things words do is get in the way. Sometimes the easiest things are the hardest to say. But I don't want to lose you drive you away. I don`t want to confuse you I need you to say only wish you knew what I wanted to say. only wish you knew what I wanted to say. My hands are shaking. I'm yours for the taking. Don`t you hesitate. Please just do one thing. One small sign something. Let`s jump off the edge. Cause all I want you to say is something real. All I wanted to know is how you feel. all I wanted you to give is your heart. but we're stuck here at the start. It`s on the tip of my tongue but I`m still afraid. sometimes the only things words do is get in the way. sometimes the easiest things are the hardest to say. but I don`t want to lose you drive you away. I don`t want to confuse you I need you to say. only wish you knew what I wanted to say. only wish you knew what I wanted to say. It`s on the tip of my tongue but I`m still afraid. sometimes the only things words do is get in the way. sometimes the easiest things are the hardest to say. but I don`t want to lose you. I don`t wanna lose you. No I don`t wanna lose you. No I don`t wanna lose you. I should`ve done something. I should`ve done something. I should`ve done something. But I never wanted to. I should`ve done something. I should`ve done something. I should`ve done something. But I never wanted to. I don`t wanna lose you. No I don`t wanna lose you. I should`ve done something. I should`ve done something. I should`ve done something. But I never wanted to. I should`ve done something. I should`ve done something. I should`ve done something. But I never wanted to
3345,Looking up into the endless sky. Staring into the maze of time. Our existance caught in the blink of an eye. Imagining other words we try. Realizing somehow we're all part of this. Wondrous cosmical tapestry. Beyond the sun. Beyond the sky. Are where the real questions lie. Wanting to know where it begins. The puzzle piece we are missing. Starlight. Flowering. Endlessly through the universal garden. Garden above. Looking up into the endless sky. Through space and time. Staring into the maze of time. We'll fly. Our existence caught in the blink of an eye. Retracing years. Imagining other worlds we try. No fears. Realizing somehow we're all part of this. Blazing a new trail. Wondrous cosmical tapestry. Beyond the sun. Beyond the sky. Are where the real questions lie. Wanting to know where it begins. The puzzle piece we are missing. Starlight. Flowering. Endlessly through the universal garden. Garden above. Investigate the science of illusion. We benefit without knowing. Our time is man-made. Our fear is man-made. Delusion man-made. Religion man-made. Love is forever. Flowering. Endlessly through the universal garden. Garden above. Beyond the sun. Beyond the sky. Are where the real questions lie. Wanting to know where it begins. The puzzle piece we are missing. Beyond the sun. Beyond the sky. Are where the real questions lie. Universal garden.
3348,The devil may smile with an angels face. A cat may be stolen of its grace. They say it's just a matter of time and place. A man may be less than an animal. The antichrist write up the honor roll. The tightrope walker take the final fall (at his house in the bathroom on a holiday and that's in the news). Oh the things you see. Makes ignorance bliss for you and me yeah. When arrogance does publicity. Smiling happily. It's a merry go round and around and around. The begging boy becomes the begging man. The zealot never saves the sacrificial lamb. And a child want's to know if the Candyman can. Everybody want's the fancy car. And we've all been told not to run too far. But everybody wants to be a rock'n'roll star. Oh the things you see. Makes arrogance seem the way to be yeah. When ignorance spreads conformity. Smiling happily. It's a merry go round and around and around
3349,I get so nervous I'm shaking. Gets so I got no pride at all. Gets so bad but I just keep coming back for more. I guess I just get off on that stuff. I'm thinking about taking some time. I'm thinking about leaving soon. I got some things I can't tell anyone. I got some things I just can't say. They're the kind of things no one knows about. I just need somebody to talk to me. I'm thinking about leaving tomorrow. I'm thinking about leaving on my own. I think I been wasting my time. I'm thinking about getting out. In all this time. The bottom line's you don't know how much I feel. You say you see but I don't agree. You don't know how I feel. I'm just trying to get myself some gravity. You're just trying to get me to stay. Sometimes I sit here looking down upon Los Angeles. Sometimes I'm floating away. I'm thinking about breaking myself. I'm thinking about getting back home. I think I been waiting for way too long. I'm thinking about getting out.
3350,It's Christmas in America. There's carols in the air. The snow falling on the ground. There's holly everywhere. The people they're all different too. Their troubles put aside. They smile a little brighter. It seems at Christmas time. It's Christmas in America. Let the angels sing. It's Christmas in America. Let freedom ring. Let peace resound throughout the world. Especially on this day. It's Christmas in America. God bless the USA. The kids get so excited. Preparing for the day. Their letters to Santa have all been sent. The cookies have been baked. The creche under the Christmas tree. Awaits the baby child. It seems to mean so much more this year. Than it has in a while. Coz It's Christmas in America. Let the angels sing. It's Christmas in America. Let freedom ring. Let peace resound throughout the world. Especially on this day. It's Christmas in America. God bless the USA. So keep your babies close tonight. Hug your husband kiss your wife. Be thankful for this way of life. We're fortunate to share. And not forget the ones we've lost. Their memory lives on in our hearts. They'll be forever in our thoughts. And always in our prayers. Unto this world a child is born. His gift was meant for everyone. The light of peace shines on and on. And never fades away. America America indivisible we are. One nation under God. And that will never change. Coz It's Christmas in America. Let the angels sing. It's Christmas in America. Let freedom ring. Let peace resound throughout the world. Especially on this day. It's Christmas in America. God bless the USA. It's Christmas in America.

3388,Waking up again another sleepless night. Climbing taller buildings more dreams of flight. In a pool of sweat not knowing what to do. No more earth-bound feelings a diff'rent point of view. Moment of truth he heads towards the building. His glazed eyes stare vacantly following his feelings. No turning back the door's already shutting. Standing on his tiptoes to reach the nineteenth button. To miss a grasping hand. (I'm falling again). And squash a passer-by. (I'm falling again). He wanted to see some evidence. (I'm falling again). That he could really fly. Balanced on the edge only time could tell. Some say he was pushed others say he fell. Standing on that rooftop his brain told him 'no'. But all the dreams in nights before told him he must go. To miss a grasping hand. (I'm falling again). And squash a passer-by. (I'm falling again). He wanted to see some evidence. (I'm falling again). That he could really fly. His questions and himself. Nearly fell on stony ground. He could've embarrassed his family. Who watched him from the crowd. Balanced on the edge only time could tell. Some say he was pushed others say he fell. To miss a grasping hand. (I'm falling again). And squash a passer-by. (I'm falling again). He wanted to see some evidence. (I'm falling again). That he could really fly. (I'm falling ...).

3392,Head in the clouds. Light as a feather weightless. Make love to my mind. Now my body's out there faded. I'm no longer the same. Love will be changing. You're just a big ball of temptation.

3393,They were hiding behind hay bales. They were planting in the full moon. They had given all they had for something new. But the light of day was on them. They could see the thrashers coming. And the water shone like diamonds in the dew.. And I was just getting up hit the road before it's light. Trying to catch an hour on the sun. When I saw those thrashers rolling by. Looking more than two lanes wide. I was feelin' like my day had just begun.. Where the eagle glides ascending. There's an ancient river bending. Down the timeless gorge of changes. Where sleeplessness awaits. I searched out my companions. Who were lost in crystal canyons. When the aimless blade of science. Slashed the pearly gates.. It was then I knew I'd had enough. Burned my credit card for fuel. Headed out to where the pavement turns to sand. With a one-way ticket to the land of truth. And my suitcase in my hand. How I lost my friends I still don't understand.. They had the best selection. They were poisoned with protection. There was nothing that they needed. Nothing left to find. They were lost in rock formations. Or became park bench mutations. On the sidewalks and in the stations. They were waiting waiting.. So I got bored and left them there. They were just deadweight to me. Better down the road without that load. Brings back the time when I was eight or nine. I was watchin' my mama's T.V.. It was that great Grand Canyon rescue episode.. Where the vulture glides descending. On an asphalt highway bending. Thru libraries and museums galaxies and stars. Down the windy halls of friendship. To the rose clipped by the bullwhip. The motel of lost companions. Waits with heated pool and bar.. But me I'm not stopping there. Got my own row left to hoe. Just another line in the field of time. When the thrashers comes I'll be stuck in the sun. Like the dinosaurs in shrines. But I'll know the time has come. To give what's mine.. .
3394,The wind is blowing cold. Have we lost our way tonight?. Have we lost our hope to sorrow?. Feels like we're all alone. Running further from what's right. And there are no more heroes to follow. So what are we becoming?. Where did we go wrong?. [Chorus:]. Yeah oh yeah. I want to rise today. And change this world. Yeah oh yeah. Oh won't you rise today. And change this world?. The sun is beating down. Are we ever gonna change. Can we stop the blood from running?. Our time is running out. Hope we find a better way. Before we find we're left with nothing. For every life that's taken. So much love is wasted. Yeah oh yeah. I want to rise today. And change this world. Yeah oh yeah. So won't you rise today. And change. This world. Only love can set it right. This world. If only peace would never die. Seems to me that we've got each other wrong. Was the enemy just your brother all along?. Yeah oh yeah. I want to rise today. And change this world. Yeah oh yeah. Oh won't you rise today. And change this world?. Yeah oh yeah. I want to rise today. And change this world. Yeah oh yeah. I want to rise today. And change this world
3396,The way I see it? he said. ?You just can't win it?. Everybody's in it for their own gain. You can't please ?em all. There's always somebody calling you down. I do my best. And I do good business. There's a lot of people asking for my time. They're trying to get ahead. They're trying to be a good friend of mine. (chorus). I was a free man in Paris. I felt unfettered and alive. There was nobody calling me up for favors. And no one's future to decide. You know I'd go back there tomorrow. But for the work I've taken on. Stoking the star maker machinery. Behind the popular song. I deal in dreamers. And telephone screamers. Lately I wonder what I do it for. If l had my way. I'd just walk through those doors. And wander. Down the Champs Elysees. Going cafe to cabaret. Thinking how I'll feel when I find. That very good friend of mine. (chorus). I was a free man in Paris. I felt unfettered and alive. Nobody was calling me up for favors. No one's future to decide. You know I'd go back there tomorrow. But for the work I've taken on. Stoking the star maker machinery. Behind the popular song
3397,Tear your playhouse. Tear your playhouse tear your playhouse down. Tear your playhouse tear your playhouse down. Oh all that money it's going underground. Baby all that money. All that money don't it make you frown. All that money don't it make you frown. Careless love done tore your playhouse down. All that money all that money. All that pounds shillings and pence. All that money all that pounds shillings and pence. All that money but it's just no common sense. Going down to Florida going down to Florida. Gonna move you off my mind. Going down to Florida I'm gonna get you off my mind. Going down to Florida just to bide my time. All that money. All that money don't it make you frown. All that money don't it make you frown. Careless love done burned your playhouse down playhouse down. Careless love done burned your playhouse down. Burned your playhouse burned your playhouse down
3398,Rubber Band. There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune. In the library garden Sunday afternoon. While a little chappie waves a golden wand. Rubber Band. In 1910 I was so handsome and so strong. My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long. And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes. Dear Rubber Band you're playing my tune out of tune. oh. Rubber Band. Won't you play a haunting theme again to me. While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea. The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon. Oh play that theme. Rubber Band. How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band. We could play in lively parks throughout the land. And one Sunday afternoon I'd find my love. Rubber Band. In the '14-'18 war I went to sea. Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me. And now she's married to the leader of the band oh.
3399,The Summer dying. September lives in flames.. The sisters dancing. No happy ending to the game.. Don't bother to call me. Think I'll stay here just the same.. Flaming September. What can you give me that is true ?. Do you remember. Do you remember. Do you remember. All the life I gave to you ?. The Summer dying. September lives in flames.. My youth lies bruised and broken. No happy ending to the game.. Don't bother to tell me. I'll live on here just the same.. Flaming September. What can you show me that is new ?. My heart remembers. Do you remember. Do you remember. All the life I gave to you ?. Flaming September. What can you show me that is true ?. My heart remembers. Do you remember. Do you remember. All the life I gave. To you ?. Flaming September..
3400,The fight is over now the bright lights turned somehow. The strength I have is running out the current pulls me down. I'm wondering. Is anybody out there who's cold and incomplete inside?. I can hear Him calling. Come and follow me my child. The twilight turns to day with all your love displayed. The stars they bow in awe when the lost return to you. Draws up my heart deep from the well. I know He's Finding every lost and broken dream
3401,I woke up in a warehouse. But the label had fell off. Just minding my own meltdown. It was then I heard the cannibals cannibals. They said hey kid... You got that something special. (It's now or never). You wanna live forever. (It's now or never). You know what we want you should give it to us. (It's now or never). But there's no pressure. And I keep picking petals. I'm afraid you don't love me anymore. cos a kid on the gram. In a black dahlia tank. Says it ain't heavy metal. (And that's alright). (That's alright). I tried to do a headcount. But I cut off all the crusts. Said they liked it better curly. Then they gut me like an animal. They said hey man. You had that something special. (It's now or never). Let's keep it quintessential. (It's now or never). You know what we want why not give it to us. (It's now or never). But there's no pressure. So I keep picking petals. I'm afraid they don't love me anymore. Cos some kid on the gram. In a black dahlia tank. Says it ain't heavy metal. Yeah I keep picking petals. Got my heart and my head all in the wars. Cos some kid from A n R. in a Patagonia. Said he don't really get it. So I keep picking petals. All I wanna know do you love me anymore. Cos some kid on the gram says he used to be fan. But this shit ain't heavy metal. (And that's alright). And I keep picking petals. I'm afraid you don't love me anymore. cos a kid on the gram. In a black dahlia tank. Says it ain't heavy metal. Yeah I keep picking petals.

3404,We're looking in the same direction. But you don't see what I see. Just a half moon in your perception. It looks full to me. Oh my head is caught caught in clouds. but your buried so so far down. You drag me down to earth. You stomp my heart it hurts. You weigh me down. The way your pulling me. You're worse than gravity.

This is the relationship. You are the best in being Mr. Negative. You weigh me down. You drag me down to earth. You stomp my heart it hurts. You weigh me down. The way you're pulling me. You're worse than gravity. You weigh me down. You weigh me down. You drag me down to earth. You stomp my heart it hurts. You weigh me down. The way you're pulling me. You're worse than gravity. You weigh me down. You weigh me down. You weigh me down (me down)
3405,Arrest this woman. Showered under some tears. When no light shines. But the garden's in bloom. For every fragile light. Is marked by clouds. Cast from grey memories. And time is feeling like a scraping wind. A distant frost a murmured spring. And though I never feel an older's wrath. Convention seems an easier path. Under the sheltered morning. The emperor longs the frame. For whoever turned the light on. I thank you. Arrest these orchids. That hide behind the light. Until the morning comes. Arrest this woman. My shelter from the night. Arrest these orchids. There's something gone. Arrest these orchids. There's nothing blooming. Arrest these orchids. There's something gone. Arrest these orchids

Lifes the memories we went. Through to find and carry. On to stars beyond. You pulled me through. All of eternity. All these nights and all these. Lifes the memories we went.

3413,Warren Zevon Zevon Music BMI. You've got an invalid haircut. It hurts when you smile. You'd better get out of town. Before your nickname expires. It's the kingdom of the spiders. It's the empire of the ants. You need a permit to walk around downtown. You need a license to dance. Life'll kill ya. That's what I said. Life'll kill ya. Then you'll be dead. Life'll find ya.

3418,I took a ride in an automobile. Pushed my hands out against the wheel. Asked a girl if she needed a ride. She said “Sure babe but I wanna drive”. Hey now wait awhile. We’re going down with a smile. Cold river – she took me down. Cold river – she took my pride. Had to stop on account of the storm. Seemed like years since I’d been warm. We droved all night till the tires blew. Got in the back and did what you do. Hey now wait awhile. We’re going down with a smile. Cold river – she took my pride. Cold river – she took my pride. On a sunny day. On a sunny day. (She took my pride). All the money you made. Did you need it babe.
3419,I say hey I'll be gone today. But I'll be back all around the way. It seems like everywhere I go. The more I see the less I know. But I know one thing. That I love you (baby girl). I love you I love you I love you. I've been a lot of places all around the way. I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain. But I don't want to write a love song for the world. I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl. Kids on the corner always calling my name. And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games. When I saw you getting down well I hope it was you. And when I look into your eyes I knew it was true. I say hey I'll be gone today. But I'll be back all around the way. It seems like everywhere I go. The more I see the less I know. But I know one thing. That I love you (baby girl). I love you I love you I love you. Now I'm not a highly metaphysical man. But I know when the stars are aligned you can. Bump into a person in the middle of the road. Look into their eyes and you suddenly know. Rocking in the dance hall moving with you. Dancing in the night in the middle of June. My momma told me don't lose you. 'Cause the best luck I had was you. I say hey I'll be gone today. But I'll be back all around the way. It seems like everywhere I go. The more I see the less I know. But I know one thing. That I love you (baby girl). I love you I love you I love you. And I say rocking in the dance hall moving with you. I say hey momma hey momma close to you. Rocking in the dance hall moving with you. I say hey poppa hey poppa close to you. Rocking in the dance hall moving with you. I say hey momma hey momma close to you. Rocking in the dance hall moving with you. I say hey momma hey momma hey momma hey momma. Hey momma hey momma hey momma hey momma. I say hey I'll be gone today. But I'll be back all around the way. It seems like everywhere I go. The more I see the less I know. But I know one thing. That I love you (baby girl). I love you I love you I love you. I love you I love you I love you
3421,The Boy Done Good. . Strange as it may seem I once had my football dreams. But I was always the last one the last to get chosen. When my classmates picked their teams. I guess that was the way it stayed in every game I played. Life just tripped me and clattered and kicked me. Till you picked me from the parade. Now I feel like I've won the cup every time that we. make love. Forty-five minutes each way at halftime I hear a brass. band play. The boy done good the girl done better. The seasons turn and we're still together. The sky is still blue and tomorrow is another day. You weren't that kind of a girl who likes her studs to. be covered in mud. Taking you to the pictures was a regular fixture. For one of life's eternal subs. I tried hard acting tough but I just can't stand the. taste of that stuff. Like some macho park player I got in the way of. In some grudge match against his club. But I'm happier how I am today now I've put my. boots away. I guess I'll never get picked to play my song on Match. of the Day.
3422,I forgot the feeling. The feeling of being alone. But not lonely. I guess when you touch me. My fears and my secrets. Belong to you only. Close the door behind you. Just let me love you slow you hold you. My mind stays on you. So does my body let me show you. But I wanna go through. And I wanna need you. Could you be my muse. Lately all I think about is you. I'm never sick about it. This love's incredible-credible. Have a little mercy on me. Baby you got me. Wanting more wanting more. Of your love. Incredible-credible. Have a little mercy on me. Baby you got me. Wanting more wanting more. Of your love. I know you've been hurt. By the way that you look away. From me too early. You don't like to talk about it. But it was fine I get it. So don't worry. But I wanna go through. And I wanna need you. Could you be my muse. Lately all I think about is you. I'm never sick about it. This love's incredible-credible. Have a little mercy on me. Baby you got me. Wanting more wanting more. Of your love. Incredible-credible. Have a little mercy on me. Baby you got me. Wanting more wanting more. Of your love. Wanting more wanting more. Of your love. Wanting more wanting more. Of your love. This love. Wanting more wanting more
3423,Will you walk us uptown?. And wherever you go. You know we will follow. Will you walk us uptown?. And we'll stand in the light. Of your new killing ground. And we won't make a sound. Except to sing our sorrow. Will you walk us uptown?. While our tears run in torrents. To suffer in silence or pray for some solace. Will you wash away our sins. In the cross-fire and cross-currents. As you uncross your fingers. And take out some insurance. No matter what the price. It's your own paradise. Will you walk us uptown?. Will you walk us uptown?. Some hearts are sinking. And some hearts are a-flutter. Some scoop gold from the dirt in the gutter. Or swallow the earth. Pouring into your mouth. As they bury us upright saying. 'Everything's alright'. Will you walk us uptown?. Like some said that you could. We will feast on your flesh. And drink down your blood. Will you haul down that flag. And dishonour that vow. Cause we must not change. It's color now. Will you walk us uptown?. No matter what the price. Each crushed in the corner of their own paradise. Will you walk us uptown?. Will you walk us uptown?. That's always assuming. That you're partly divine and partly human. You're the king of our hearts. You're the clown with the drum. Will you walk us uptown?. If we promise not to run. Will you walk us uptown?. Will you gather us near. As cowards flee and traitors sneer. Keep a red flag flying. Keep a blue flag as well. And a white flag in case it all goes to hell

3425,(feat. Suzie McNeil). The world is always changing you can see it every day. But in a tragic situation you just can't hide yourself away. So try a little kindness cause it sure can't be that hard. You're shining in the darkness when you open up your heart. Your love is all we need to bring us together. Don't leave it to me nothing's for free it comes down to us. Hungry babies on television can you feel the shame?. We've got to keep on giving to one another 'cause it's all gonna happen again. Why don't you try a little kindness cause it sure can't be that hard. Just think about what binds us and find a new place to start. Your love is all we need to bring us together. Don't leave it to me nothing's for free it comes down to us. Your love is all we need to bring us together. We're not indestructable we're some kind of miracle. Happens every day

3428,"I write your name in my breath on the window. Sit and watch as it fades away. The painful memories of the tears of yesterday. The sky is gold and grey. Just like it was when we both went our seperate ways. And the rain won't wash away. All the dirt of my mistakes. So I write your name in my breath on the window. Sit and watch as it fades away. The painful memories of the tears of yesterday. Defening sound of rain. It's not enough to drown my thoughts. So ease the pain. So instead I'll soak it in. While I stare outside again. So I write your name in my breath on the window. Sit and watch as it fades away. The painful memories of the tears of yesterday. I try so hard but I can't seem to let go. I lost so much when you walked away. The painful memories of the tears of yesterday. The sun just won't seem to come out. Now that you've walked away. Now I cannot escape. I cannot escape the rain. The rain. So I write your name in my breath on the window. Sit and watch as it fades away. The painful memories of the tears of yesterday. I try so hard but I can't seem to let go. I lost so much when you walked away. The painful memories of the tears of yesterday. Yesterday. Yesterday. . 6ª Faixa do CD ""For(n)ever"" de 2009. Enviada por: Lucas Froner"
3429,I've seen flowers and saints. And sinners burning secrets as they're cigarettes burn out. There's no one to hold you now. I've seen tears and blame. And people who don't give a fuck bout what we dream about. There's no one to hold me now. I just wanna see you one more day. The family can't look behind. They know the truth but lately they are living just a lie. Look how they've made you cry. White stripes and dead lights. A shotgun standing over firing straight into your mind. There's no one to save us now. I just wanna see you one more day. Is this what you want me to show?. Is this what you want me to know?. 'cause we miss you right now. And I miss you right now. Could you return someway somehow?. Could you return could you return?. I just wanna see you one more day

3438,Here a tower shinning bright. Once stood gleaming in the night. Where now there's just the rubble. In the hole here the paddies and the frogs. Came to gamble on the dogs. Came to gamble on the dogs not long ago. Oh the torn up ticket stubs. From a hundred thousand mugs. Now washed away with dead dreams in the rain. And the car-parks going up. And they're pulling down the pubs. And its just another bloody rainy day. Oh sweet city of my dreams. Of speed and skill and schemes. Like Atlantis you just disappeared from view. And the hare upon the wire. Has been burnt upon your pyre. Like the black dog that once raced. Out from trap two.

3447,Its good to be alive in the peaceful revolution. An honor to observe the beautiful solution. I tip my hat to we the people in order to form a more perfect world. This shall come to pass. The beginning of the end. Of the ignorance that once could sin. The tyrant to power. His day is done. In the worldwide revolution. Yeah the peaceful revolution. All around this small world. Now the people demand to listen. These truths self-evident. Philosophical evolution. As the old die out. The young see a better way. Human rights guaranteed to all. Without regard to race I say. The beginning of the end. Now the people vote we will not sin. The tyrant to power. His day is done. In the worldwide revolution. In the peaceful revolution. I see the last frontier and the peaceful revolution. World peace is merely a product of social evolution. The conquest lies in accepting different peoples. And thinking right here at home. In the suns kingdom. The beginning of the end. And of the tolerance that once could sin. The tyrant to power. His day is done. In the worldwide revolution. In the peaceful revolution. Its the peaceful revolution. Its the peaceful revolution.
3448,Bishop danced with a thumbscrew woman. Did a double-quick back-flip and slid across the floor. The Catholic traffic flowed freely across the river. And Fiddlestick fiddled quick out the front door. Baby dumpling mama's in the back tree. If the bough breaks mama might fall. Little sad and only baby don't be lonely. Mama knows 'rithmetic knows how to take a fall. Mama knows 'rithmetic knows how to take a fall. And the kids are crying. Flapjacks make'em fat early in the morning. Little Jack grab your hat. hear the breakfast call. Muskrat bad old cat kick him in the fireplace. There's someone in the kitchen blowing Dinah on their. horn. There's someone in the kitchen blowing Dinah like they're. born. Maverick Daddy got one-night prize. The glides like a monkey-mule kickin' on the backslide. Over hill over hill Daddy don't you spill now. Papa got a switch-stick he's pumping little Bill. Papa got a switch-stick he's pumping little Bill. And Bill he's crying. Tomahawk tomahawk Daddy better duck out. The Mohawks the Mohawks they're still out there in the woods. Molatar Okenah running through my dreams now. With fire on their fingertips and injun's screams. Fire on their fingertips and feathers made of moonbeams. Early in the morning the cannoneer cried. I seem the sailor's warning in the western sky. Oh mountain man if you can cut me down a fir tree. Branches full of candlesticks for baby and me. And my darling cried she said Honey the weather vane. lately it's been pointin' the way to heaven. Scatterbrains Scatterbrains watch out where you fall Champagne champagne. a round for all the old choirboys. They're bustin' off the altar chasing. Dinah through the hall. They're bustin' off the altar chasing. Dinah through the hall. And like kids they're crying. Flapjacks make 'em fat early in the morning. Little Jack grab your hat. hear the breakfast call. Muskrat bad old cat kick him in the fireplace. There's someone in the kitchen blowing. Dinah on their horn. There's someone in the kitchen blowing. Dinah like they're born..
3449,Patience only gets you so far. Blood will get you further. Pain will only make your heart hard. Tossed in furious weather. Innocence is beautiful to see. Won't you box it up for me?. For me. Oh give me strength and give me peace. Does anyone out there want to hear me?. It's just another downpour. Don't let it get the best of you. It's only up from the floor. Light everything inside of you. Don't burn out don't burn out on me. Don't burn out don't burn out on me. Sadness is my enemy. I fear time will age him gently. Walking by my side for all these years. Seems that we've grown friendly. Happiness is beautiful to see. Won't you box it up for me?. For me. Oh give me strength and give me peace. Does anyone out there want to hear me?. It's just another downpour. Don't let it get the best of you. It's only up from the floor. Light everything inside of you. Don't burn out don't burn out on me. Don't burn out don't burn out on me.

I don't wanna let you go. Don't burn out don't burn out on me
3450,"The King sits in Dunfirmline town drinking of the blood-red wine. ""Where can I get a steely skipper to sail this might boat of mine?"". Then up there spoke a bonny boy sitting at the King's right knee. ""Sir Patrick Spens is the very best seaman that ever sailed upon the sea"". The King has written a broad letter and sealed it up with his own right hand. Sending word unto Sir Patrick to come to him at his command. ""An enemy then this must be who told the lie concerning me. For I was never a very good seaman nor ever do intend to be"". ""Last night I saw the new moon clear with the new moon in her hair. And that is a sign since we were born that means there'll be a deadly storm"". They had not sailed upon the deep a day a day but barely free. When loud and boisterous blew the winds and loud and noisy blew the sea. Then up there came a mermaiden a comb and glass all in her hand. ""Here's to you my merry young men for you'll not see dry land again"". ""Long may my lady stand with a lantern in her hand. Before she sees my bonny ship come sailing homeward to dry land"". Forty miles off Aberdeen the waters fifty fathoms deep. There lies good Sir Patrick Spens with the Scots lords at his feet"

3456,(William Shakespeare). Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck. And yet methinks I have astronomy;. But not to tell of good or evil luck. Of plagues or dearths or seasons' quality;. Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell. Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind. Or say with princess if it whall go well. By oft predict that I in heaven find.. But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive. And constant stars in them I read such art. As truth and beauty shall together thrive. If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert:. Or else of thee this I prognosticate. They and is truth's and beauty's doom and date..
3457,I'm wide awake. I'm wide awake. I'm wide awake. Yeah I was in the dark. I was falling hard. With an open heart. I'm wide awake. How did I read the stars so wrong. I'm wide awake.

Wouldn't bow down. Gravity hurts. You made it so sweet. Till I woke up on. On the concrete. Falling from cloud nine. Crashing from the high. I'm letting go tonight. I'm falling from cloud nine. I'm wide awake. Not losing any sleep. Picked up every piece. And landed on my feet. I'm wide awake. Need nothing to complete myself no. I'm wide awake. Yeah I am born again. Out of the lion's den. I don't have to pretend. And it's too late. The story's over now the end. I wish I knew then. What I know now. Wouldn't dive in. Wouldn't bow down. Gravity hurts. You made it so sweet. Till I woke up on. On the concrete. Falling from cloud nine. Crashing from the high. I'm letting go tonight. I'm falling from cloud nine. Thunder rumbling. Castles crumbling. I am trying to hold on. God knows that I tried. Seeing the bright side. But I'm not blind anymore. I'm wide awake. I'm wide awake. Falling from cloud nine. Crashing from the high. I'm letting go tonight.

3475,Let me be. What a way for one to realize. Got away so bored now I seem. How he is so happy feeling sad. Everly depressed. Go die you. Think I will enjoy the view-oy the view-oy the view. Everything is standing still-ill-ill.
3477,"I just don't understand it. Well there's something at our door. Now we're fighting together. As dogs of war. When the moon is shining. And you're wrapped around our sins. Then our souls starts a-howling. And the show begins. Over where the city starts. Something comes and slips into its heart. Snakes and lovers. Try to shed our sins. We're undercover. But it's slipped beneath our skins. Snakes and lovers. Holding on in the night. Are you sleeping tight?. In our Garden of Eden. With the poison in disguise. We had grown love together. In paradise. Now Utopia's falling. And the messages are clear. That the evil is crawling. And fear is near. Now temptation comes to try. So I bite the apple of my eye. Snakes and lovers. Try to shed our sins. We're undercover. But it's slipped beneath our skins. Snakes and lovers. Holding on in the night. Are you sleeping tight?. Now you're alone in your room. And all of the walls they are turning. And down on the streets where I walk. The light on my eyes it is burning. So come on and take me my dear. And bear the fruits of what we know. Then our minds will be clear. And our hearts will not let go. Just one more step. And we will be over. Snakes and lovers. Try to shed our sins. We're undercover. But it's slipped beneath our skins. Snakes and lovers. Holding on in the night. Are you sleeping tight?. Holding on in the night. Are you sleeping tight?. Lyrics from <a href=""http://www.elyrics.net"">eLyrics.net</a>"
3478,She came from providence one in Rhode Island. Where the old world shadows hang heavy in the air. She packed her hopes and dreams like a refugee. Just as her father came across the sea.. She heard about a place people were smiling. Spoke about the red mans way the howling of the land. They came from everywhere to the Great Divide. Seeking a place to stay or a place to hide.. Down in the crowded bars out for a good time. Can't wait to tell you all what it's like up there. They call it Paradise I don't know why. Somebody laid the mountains low while the tide got high.. Then the chilly winds blew down across the desert. Through the canyons out the coast to the Malibu. Where the pretty people play hunting for power. Too like them in your ways give 'em things to do. Some rich man came and wrecked the land. Nobody caught him. They call it paradise the place to be. They watched the hazy sun sinking in the sea. You can leave it all behind and sail to Ohio. Just like the missionaries did so many years ago. But even down in the outside Jesus is coming. He bought the white mans burden down. He bought the white mans ring. Who will provide the grand design..what is yours and what is mine. Cause there is no more new frontier. We have got to make it here satisfy your endless needs. And justify your bloody deeds. In the name of destiney In the name of God. And you can see them there on a Sunday morning. Stand up and sing about what it's like up there. They call it Paradise I don't know why. Call some place Paradise Kiss it goodbye.
3480,You make me feel like a hat stand. All tall grim and brown. You make me feel like a clothes horse. Old and left out in the rain. You sure say you can. Also shared you with the others. I couldn't stand it. You make me feel like a deserted house. Dark and empty in the dusk. You made me feel like a charred foot. In a burnt out factory. You insist that I split. Cast me into the pit with the others. So many of them down there. Now it's so dark dark dark. Not a tiny spot of hope for me. Now I want you so much. I need a crutch by the time you set me free. Now it's so dark dark dark. Not a tiny spot of hope for me. Now I want you so much. I need a crutch by the time you set me free. You make me feel like a broken yellow yo-yo. Thrown away on a dump. You make me feel like a flower. Makin' way for a petrol pump. You ruined my days. With your poisoned ways. Like you did the others. So many others. Wonderin' down here. Hello man how are things?. Dark isn't it?. What a woman?. Wonder when she'll let us out

3487,Tattoo your name across my heart. Every letter bold and dark. So that every time I breathe. You can know you're bringing me relief. I have stalked those hollow halls of lust. I do it for you I do it for us. The trinity of honor love and trust. I do it for you I do it for us. A mirror in the hand. Is worth ten from afar. Come close enough so I can feel you breathe. And see for who you truly are. I have stalked those hollow halls of lust. Do it for you do it for us. The sunset burns of flaming ash and dust. I do it for you I do it for us. I do it for you..... I have stalked those hollow halls of lust. I do it for you I do it for us. The trinity of honor love and trust. I do it for you I do it for us. I do it for you.

They're finding where you are. If you are then you know the phone's tapped. The last of the maps are breaking codes. You've seen the night thieves like sharpened knife bleeds through. The moon shows that you're in reverse. The moon shows that you're in reverse. Breathing in the dark. They're finding where you are

You're messin' with Murder Incorporated. Now you check over your shoulder everywhere that you go (oh yeah). Walkin down the streets there's eyes in every shadow (oh yeah). You better take a look around you (come on down). That equipment you got's so outdated. You can't compete with Murder Incorporated. Everywhere you look now there's Murder Incorporated.

So complicated you keep complaining some bones hurtin'. I hear that you you got dogged downtown man it leaves your head cold (oh. yea). And everywhere you look life ain't got no soul (oh yeah). That apartment you live in feels like it's just a place to hide. When your walkin' down the streets you won't need nowhere there to hide. Now the cops reported you as just another homicide. I could tell that you was just frustrated from livin' with Murder. Incorporated. Incorporated. Everywhere you look now. Murder Incorporated. Down on your knees. Murder.

Just for me
3496,Party girl's got her shiny dress on. Look at those party moves. She's lookin' for a good time. She loves to dance and she loves the action. Wherever the party goes. She's lookin' for a good time. You're never gonna see a tear in her eye. Never see her break a frown. She's lookin' for a good time. The way she dances makes my world stand still. And she's spinning in the sky. Every move is like a psychedelic pill. From a doctor I can't buy.
3498,It took me 22 years to trust myself. Too many people told me to be somebody else. They said ?there's two things you gotta do to succeed.. 1- forget about you. 2- listen to me.?. But on the 20th day of December this year. what I needed to do became ever clear. I got drunk and I cried and I fell asleep. When I woke up I knew who I needed to be. Took off my shoes and my socks and I ran through the snow. Through the center of town I left long ago. Frost bite on my ankles and I don't care. Got some shit on my mind that I wanna share. I'm riding around old stomping grounds. Riding around on sacred ground. I know where I'm going cuz I know where I've been. I've been- riding around old stomping grounds. Ridin' around this small town. Finally know where I'm going. Back to the beginning again. Take 'em to the strip club. Make a Euro pop song. Do whateva I say. Industry get along. You should do a cover song. You should make a Katy song. You should pull your titties out. Then I'll put your record out. ...then I'll put your record out
3500,So your plane was late. You missed that date. And your horse can't win. So you drink another bottle of gin. And your shares went down. They touched the ground. And your best laid plans. Have slipped right out of your hands. So you think you're fat. Well that's a fact. But your well ran dry. So you had to walk another mile. Think about them think about them. Think about those who'll never see another year. Think about them. Think about those who never saw. So your car won't start. Needs a special part. But you made your choice. Now you're stuck with all your big boys toys. Now the word's around. You've gone aground. And you've lost your wind. You'll never see your ship come in. Think about them think about them. Think about those who'll never see another year. Think about them. Think about those who'll never see another year. Mother's father's. Sister's brother's. Old man young man. Whale song all gone. Where did we go wrong. Think about those who'll never see another. Those who'll never see another. Those who'll never see. Think about them think about them.. (Charlton).

They'll be the ones with nothing to hide. 'Cause I've been thinking thinking. I've got a plan to lose it all. I've got a contract pending on eternity. If I haven't already given it away.

3509,He's got his work and she comes easy. They each come around when the other is gone. Me I think I got stuck somewhere in between. I wouldn't confide in the Prodigal Son. The die has been cast the battle is won. The bullets were blanks a double aught gun. I couldn't admit to a minute of fun. (chorus 1). They come and they come and they come and they come. I accepted with a gentle tongue. No words spoken no need to speak. Take it stomp twice ring the bell. Tether that ring and phrase. Enough with the rifle and talk already. We all know what it means. Take this conversation to your great divide. I can only swallow what I ate. And I don't hate him. And I don't hate her. They come and they come and they come and they come. I accepted with a gentle tongue. No heart broken no need to speak. (chorus 2). (Don't talk to me). Don't talk to me about being alone. (Don't talk to me). Don't talk to me about being alone. (Don't talk to me). Don't talk to me about being alone. Reach for each other before you leave. Reach peace with a E-A-C. Don't threaten me with a gentle tease. Don't threaten me with angry. Please please please. Don't try to tell me what I am. (repeat chorus 1). (repeat chorus 2). (Talk to me). Don't talk to me. (Talk to me). Don't talk to me. (Don't talk to me). Don't talk to me.

3510,[Kim]. Yr bounce to the ounce makes us wanna pounce. Yr just being totally perfect. On Larry King you said you were tired. Time to put to bed yr competitive edge. They say you can't say no to Brahma. Now you don't have to try so hard. The label says you don't have to wear less clothes. It's time to take a bubble bath. Chorus:. Hey hey little baby breakdown. Button up baby you come undone. Hey hey little baby get down. Before you fall and hurt someone. You say you need privacy. Broken glass everywhere. Maybe you need an emo boy. No underwear on the director's chair. You are seemingly unconscious. Of what yr body is doing. Like Miss Monroe yr head don't know. Exactly what yr body's doing. Chorus. On TV you're soft and whispery. Delicate like angel food cake. They say if you press too hard on it. It will squish into a dense ball. It will lose its fluffiness. That's what you get when you use a box mix. Can you get some satisfaction. How much are you willing to pay?. Chorus. What's yr gut feeling about the new deal. How's the label gonna remake you?. How was yr date with Eminem. Did he bake you and then forsake you. Is innocence gonna still overtake you. Like Arthur Doyle they can't fake you. Oh Mariah you are endless. Like the wind you feel defenseless. Chorus
3511,Strange infatuation seems to grace the evening tide. I'll take it by your side. Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide. I'll take it by your side. Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies. I'll take it by your side. Oversaturation curls the skin and tans the hide. I'll take it by your side. Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tick. Tick. Tick. Tick tock. I'm unclean a libertine. And every time you vent your spleen. I seem to lose the power of speech. You're slipping slowly from my reach. You grow me like an evergreen. You've never seen the lonely me at all. I. Take the plan spin it sideways. I. Fall. Without you I'm nothing. Without you I'm nothing. Without you I'm nothing. Take the plan spin it sideways. Without you I'm nothing at all
3512,You're beautiful that's for sure. You'll never ever fade. You're lovely but it's not for sure. I won't ever change. And though my love is rare. Though my love is true. (Chorus:). I'm like a bird I'll only fly away. I don't know where my soul is I don't know where my home is. (and baby all I need for you to know is). I'm like a bird I'll only fly away. I don't know where my soul is I don't know where my home is. All I need for you to know is. Your faith in me brings me to tears. Even after all these years. And it pains me so much to tell. That you don't know me that well. And though my love is rare. And though my love is true. (Chorus). It's not that I wanna say goodbye. It's just that every time you try to tell me me that you love me. Each and every single day I know. I'm gonna have to eventually give you away. And though my love is rare rare rare. And though my love is true. Hey I'm just scared. That we may fall through. (Chorus) 2x
3513,Crack the heart with true intentions. Blood and scars and no redemption. We’ve been a slave to your disaster. Lost it all it doesn’t matter. And we don’t care at all. We got nothing to take on. And leave the rest to fall. We’re going back where we belong. Waste aways amount to nothing. But your opinions keep on coming. We’re dead inside to your rejection. Risk it all and did I mention. I’ll say it again. I’ll say it again. And we don’t care at all. We got nothing to take on. And leave the rest to fall. We’re going back where we belong. Never doubt it. Never question. What we were. And where we’ve been. Scream out loud. As our intentions. Find a word. And we don’t care at all. We got nothing to take on. And leave the rest to fall. We’re going back where we belong. I’ll say it again. And we don’t care at all. We got nothing to take on. And leave the rest to fall. We’re going back where we belong
3515,Love is an Avenue of Stars I know because I've seen the glow. Lighting up faces faces that have been. Close enough to shine at what they have seen. . Love is an Avenue of Stars and if it is light years away. One day I'll get there nursing tired feet. Happy beyond words to be on that street. . Each step is hard each step is slow. Each step unsure and yet I know. . Love is an Avenue of Stars and though I'm tired and I'm lame. My will is iron and one day I will race. Down that silver highway light on my face. . Until then until that day. One single thought lights up the way. . Love is an Avenue of Stars. . Avenue of Stars Avenue of Stars Avenue of Stars.
3516,Bind my limbs with fear (fear). Choke me with tears (tears). I won't die for you. You've been here before (before). And came back for more (more). But not this time. You'll never be strong enough. You'll never be good enough. You've never conceived in love. You will not rise above. Somebody tell me what made us all believe you. I should have known all along it was all a lie. (Should have known it was all a lie). Now I know the truth (truth). I'm through fearing you (you). And I am free. You'll never be strong enough. You'll never be good enough. You've never conceived in love. You will not rise above. Somebody tell me what made us all believe you. I should have known all along it was all a lie. (Should have known it was all a lie)
3520,And you said rise above. Open your eyes up. And you said rise above. I can't. I can't. How long will it take. Before these feelings go away?. How much longer do I wait. And are there any real answers. Anyway?. Your silence in a crowded room. Louder than the loudest tune. I hang on every word. And you said rise above. Open your eyes up. And you said rise above. I can't. I can't. I miss you and everything. I was too fast traveling. To take you in I know. But silence is no crime. Just wish could hear you fill it up one more time. Yeah I know what you'd say to me. Exactly what you'd say to me. I still hang on every word. And you said rise above. Open your eyes up. And you said rise above. Yourself. In a time of treason. Is there time for trust. When there's no them only us. Is there time for reason. Has your heart had enough?. Is there time to let go. And rise above. And you said rise above. Open your eyes to love. And you said rise above. Yourself
3523,Knew he was a killer. First time that I saw him. Wonder how many girls he had loved. And left haunted. But if he's a ghost. Then I can be a phantom. Holdin' him for ransom. Some some boys are tryin' too hard. He don't try at all though. Younger than my exes. But he act like such a man so. I see nothing better I keep him forever. Like a vendetta-ta.

Stealing hearts and running off. And never saying sorry. But if I'm a thief. Then he can join the heist. And we'll move to an island-and. And he can be my jailer. Burton to this Taylor. Every lover known in comparison is a failure. I forget their names now. I'm so very tame now. Never be the same now now. I-I-I see how this is gonna go. Touch me and you'll never be alone.

Why don't you kiss her?. Why don't you tell her?. Why don't you let her see. The feelings that you hide?. Cuz she'll never know. If you never show. The way u feel inside. Oh I'm so afraid to make that first move. Just a touch and we. Could cross the line. And everytime she's near. I wanna never let her go. Confess to her what my heart knows. Hold her close. Why don't you kiss her?. Why don't you tell her?. Why don't you let her see. The feelings that you hide?. Cuz she'll never know. If you never show. The way u feel inside. What would she say?. I wonder would she just turn away. Or would she promise me. That she's here to stay. It hurts me to wait. I keep asking myself. Why don't you kiss her (tell her you love her). Why don't you tell her (tell her you need her). Why don't you let her see. The feelings that you hide. Cuz she'll never know. If you never show. The way u feel inside. Why don't you kiss her? (Why don't you kiss her?)

My darling how long until this sun burns me?. Say hello to good times. Trade up all the fast lines. We close our eyes while the nickel and dime take the streets completely. I I always could count on futures. And things would look up they'd look up. Why so hard to find a balance. Between living decent and the cold and real. Hey now what is it you think you see?. My darling now's the time to disagree. Say hello to good times. Trade up all the fast lines. We close our eyes while the nickel and dime take the streets completely. Hey now the past is told by those who win. My darling what matters is what hasn't been. Hey now we're wide awake and we're thinking. My darling believe your votes can mean something. Say hello to good times. Trade up all the fast lines. We close our eyes while the nickel and dime take the streets completely. We close our eyes while the nickel and dime take the streets completely

3544,I used to think that I was lonely. When I was a young boy. Doinâ€™ what they told me. Too many lessons in the school class. Stated my allegiance. Mixing with the wrong class. I lived at home with all my family. Even had my own key. It was given to me. I like to be alone. There was never any friction. Starring in my own film. It was my addiction. *You don't have to wait. The world will carry on. They stare in your face. But it won't stay for long. Blessed be our nation. And sit upon her throne. (But) Don't ever hesitate. Just carry on. (*Repeat). Your older boys were rather surly. Livinâ€™ in the wrong place. Made me grow up early. But it was my home. As I complete my own existence. Staring at my own life. Fading in the distance. Down I stand in time. Smiling faces of the neighbors. Proud of their endeavors. Gonna play forever. Watch tv at home. (*Repeat). **You don't have to wait. The world will carry on. They stare in your face. But it won't stay for long. Blessed be our nation. And sit upon our throne. (But) Don't ever hesitate. Donâ€™t get it wrong. . Don't ever wait. Don't hesitate. Donâ€™t ever wait. Donâ€™t hesitate. (**Repeat 2 times). Don't wait just carry on. Don't wait we'll get along. Blessed be our nation. And sit upon her throne. Don't ever hesitate. Just carry on. Na na na na na na. (Repeat and fade).
3545,Enemy familiar friend. My beginning and my end. Broken truth whispering lies. And it hurts again. What I fear and what I try. Words I say and what I hide. All the pain I want it to end. But I want it again. And it finds me. The fight inside is coarsing through my veins. And it's raging. The fight inside is breaking me again. It's still the same pursuing pain. Isn't worth the lie I've gained. We both know how it will end. But I do it again. And it finds me. The fight inside is coarsing through my veins. And it's raging. The fight inside is hurting me again. And it finds me. The war within me pulls me under. And without you. The fight inside is breaking me again. And it finds me. The war within me pulls me under. And without you. The fight inside is breaking me again. Oh it's everything. Oh it's everything. Oh it's everything. Oh it's everything. Oh it's everything. Oh
3547,We started off incredible. Connection undeniable. I swear I thought you were the one forever. But your love was like a loaded gun. You shot me down like everyone. Cause everyone's replaceable. When you're just so incapable. Of getting past skin deep. (Chorus). Guess what another game over. I got burned but you're the real loser. I don't know why I've wasted my time with you. You're bad news a history repeater. You can't trust a serial cheater. You're good at hooking up but you suck at love. You played me like an amateur. then stabbed me like a murderer. I'm left for dead another one of your victims. It's not like you're unpredictable. But your act is so believable. I know it's nothing personal. It's just business as usual. You're good at what you do. (Chorus). Guess what another game over. I got burned but you're the real loser. I don't know why I've wasted my time with you. You're bad news a history repeater. You can't trust a serial cheater. You're good at hooking up but you suck at love. Now I kinda feel bad for you. You're never gonna know. What it's like to have someone to turn to Another day another bed. It's just a game inside your head. (Chorus). Guess what another game over. I got burned but you're the real loser. I don't know why I've wasted my time with you. You're bad news a history repeater. You can't trust a serial cheater. You're good at hooking up but you suck at love. (Chorus). Guess what another game over. I got burned but you're the real loser. I don't know why I've wasted my time with you. You're bad news a history repeater. You can't trust a serial cheater. You're good at hooking up. You messed this whole thing up. You were such an awesome fuck. But you suck at love. You suck at love
3552,If some guy tells you I don’t care. And tells you lies while I’m not there. Don’t talk to him. And if he tells you I’m untrue. Then darling here's what you must do. Don’t talk to him. And if he tells you I’ve been seen. Walking round with Sue and Jean. He’s lying again. Do anything that you want to. But darling this I beg of you. Don’t talk to him. Chorus. If you hear the words he has to say. He’ll break your heart. Let your love for me prove strong while we are far apart. So just remember what I say. And trust in me while I’m away. For I’ll be true. And just remember my true love. Is brighter than the moon above for only you. And if this guy should try to say. My love for your is only play merely a whim. Just close your eyes and count to ten. Think of me again. But don’t you talk to him. Repeat Chorus
3556,Many long years amongst the trees. Many long years underground. To be the one that's never seen. The one that stands and watches over. I wonder when we'll realize. This is what we got left. And it's on demise. With the border rising. And the answers there. Still the children smiling. And we see no share. This is what we all have seen. Too many years getting down. Even thought we couldn't believe. It's only clearer in a mirror. I wonder when we all realize. This is what we got left. And it's on demise. With the border rising. And the answers there. Still the children smiling. And we see no share. Never seen. Never seen

3558,Only you can bring back the good old days. Let’s hear it again for our long lost friend. Who passed away. Maybe it’s better that way. And even if I’m thinking upside down. You’re right side up with me my friend. You know that you’re the one for me. Only you still can see a memory. Like what about the time you took my arm. Said come with me you don’t have to be strong. Said here’s a little something to relax your mind. Now that we are two of a kind my friend. All we are is two of a kind. Only you can bring back the good old days. Like what about the time you tripped and fell. But you didn’t care ‘cause all the time you knew that you’d be getting well. You don’t do nothing and you land in jail. Farewell farewell farewell my friend. They took all your money now look what they‘ve done for you. Chump!. Only you still can see a memory. Like what about the time you took my arm. Said come with me you don’t have to be strong. Said here’s a little something to relax your mind. Now that we are two of a kind my friend. All we are is two of a kind. Save a little space for me my friend. Save a little space for me
3559,This isn't me any more. I need something to believe in. If you think you've seen the last of me. The flat line has come and gone. But won't take me away. I'm tortured. By this dream I've manufactured. War torn. From the inside out but it makes me stronger. I'm not the person you see. When you look into these eyes. I've got a reason. To believe in something more. I know there's something more. I've heard it all before. But I won't sing my last song. 'Til I'm flat out on the floor. I've longed for so much more. I wanna be the best that I can be. I'm sick and tired of being admired. I don't deserve this pedestal you've put me on. All I want is to be proud of who I am. I brought this hell upon myself. Now I gotta see it through 'til the end

You know I'm talking about this weight. In the neighboorhood people watching me. Got to move to protect my sanity. Anonymity is all I want you see. You may think it's mediocrity but. You know I'm talking about this weight. You know I'm talking ahout this weight. And this Hollywood ain't no good. I would rather be like Robin Hood. If I could only loose this....

You know I'm talking about this weight. You know I'm talking about this weight. In the very first it was rock and roll. Set me free in body and soul. But this weight is just bringing me down. It's never satisfied every time I go to town. You know I'm talking about this weight.....
3563,Music :Matthias Jabs. Lyrics:Matthias Jabs Herman Rarebell. You know nothing about loving. You lost somewhere down the line. You know nothing about giving. You should draw the line.

Who's to blame my love. All you want is money and fame. You play play with emotions. You need need a stepping stone. You're out out for sensations. Don't you don't you feel alone. Who's to blame my love. You play a dangerous game. Who's to blame my love. All you want is money and fame. Who's to blame my love. You play a dangerous game. Who's to blame my love.

3574,I thought it was funny when you missed the train. When I rang you at home they said you'd left yesterday. I thought it was strange when your car was found. By the tree in ennis where we used to hang around. Dear Isobel I hope you're well and that what you've done is right. Oh it's been such hell I wish you well. I hope you're safe tonight. It's been a long day coming and long will it last. When it's last day leaving and I'm helping it pass. By loving you more. And who would he become all the things he'd have done. Would he have loved you and not let you down?. And would he be stronger than his father?. Don't punish yourself; leave it well alone. Dear Isobel I hope you're well and what you've done is right. Oh it's been such hell I wish you well. I hope you're safe tonight. It's been a long day coming and long will it last. When it's last day leaving and I'm helping it pass. By loving you more
3575,Every little thing you do is magic lately. Every single thing that you do is cool. Every little thing you do is tragically hip. Even when you tend to play the fool. When you open up your tired eyes. And take a look at what?s inside. The mirror on your wall tells you the truth. You?re exactly where you wanna be. There is no room for streams of tears. The sun is shining down the clouds have cleared. Could you be the one for me. Could you be the one for me. Could you be the one for me. Could you be the one. Could you be the one for me. Could you be the one for me. Could you be the one for me. Could you be the one. Every single thing you do is magic baby. Every little thing that you do is cool. Every little thing you do is fashionably hip. Even when you?re mixing greens with blues. When you open up your pain stained eyes. From the night before when you were high. The smile upon your face tells you the truth. You?re exactly where you wanna be. There ain't no fear of misery. The sun is shining down the clouds have cleared. Could you be the one for me. Could you be the one for me. Could you be the one for me. Could you be the one. Could you be the one for me. Could you be the one for me. Could you be the one for me. Could you be the one oohhh.....

3576,I've got this madman in my mind. This prolific designer. And he's working overtime. And he gets all wired up. Higher and higher as we fly. We're Poets of the Fall. Perfect near fatal headlong dive. A blueprint for life blueprint your life. Aggressively primal cultural high. This mental versailles. Much grander than the lies. You tell yourself to get through the night. Sentenced to drama for life. He tears a stampede through my head. Wild and horny. Just one chance to kill it dead. But I will embrace it. Into the the darkness on we ride. To gamble is all. Perfect near fatal headlong dive. A blueprint for life blueprint your life. Aggressively primal cultural high. This mental versailles. Much grander than the lies. You tell yourself to get through the night. Sentenced to drama for life. (If all the isms and doctrines of life were a gentle breeze. Instead of that usual judgemental freeze. Would we all be as easily shanghaied to their cause. As now we seem to object every clause. And would we have the unerring nerve. To go after our deepest desires with a similar verve. Who would it serve?). Perfect near fatal headlong dive. A blueprint for life blueprint your life. Aggressively primal cultural high. This mental versailles. Much grander than the lies. You tell yourself to get through the night. Sentenced to drama for life

3578,There was a time I was one of a kind. Lost in the world out of me myself and I. Was lonely then like an alien. I tried but I never figured it out. Why I always felt like a stranger in a crowd. Ooh that was then like an alien. But the stars in the sky look like home. Take me home. And the light in your eyes lets me know. I'm not alone. Not alone not alone not alone. Not alone not alone not alone. (I'm never alone). Not alone not alone not alone. Not alone not alone not alone. Not alone. Crossed through the universe to get where you are. Travel the night riding on a shooting star. Was lonely then like an alien. Had to get used to the world I was on. While yet still unsure if I knew where I belong. Ooh that was then like an alien. But the stars in the sky look like home. Take me home. And the light in your eyes lets me know. I'm not not alone. Not alone not alone not alone. Not alone not alone not alone (I'm never alone). Not alone not alone not alone. Not alone not alone not alone. But the stars in the sky look like home. Take me home. And the light in your eyes lets me know. I'm not alone. Not alone not alone not alone. Not alone not alone not alone (I'm never alone). Not alone not alone not alone. Na na na na na na na na na
3580,Nights fall hard on Hollywood. The stars don't come out like they should. Up above the world so high tonight. They can't outshine the neon lights. Now the golden days are gone for good. In Esmeralda's Hollywood. She comes out when the sun is gone. But she don't have to walk alone. Cause once the darkness takes this town. She ain't the only ghost around. Waitin' by the public phone. If it don't ring she heads back home. Esmeralda Esmeralda girl what are you waitin' for. Esmeralda Esmeralda can't hang around this place no more. Searchlights rip the L.A. sky. When you look in Esmeralda's eyes. The people come from miles around. To see the kings and queens they crowned. Behind the barricades they stood. In Esmeralda's Hollywood. Aw wait until the sun goes down. Listen for the lonely sound. Esmeralda's hanging round. No one shed a tear that day. When Esmeralda passed away. All up and down the strip they say. It was just like any other day. The evil struggled with the good. Down in Esmeralda's Hollywood

3584,This is how I tell it. Oh but it's long. One Sunday morning. Oh one son is gone. I can see where they're dawning. Over the sea. My father said what I had become. No-one should be. Outside I look lived in. Like the bones in a shrine. How am I forgiven?. Oh I'll give it time. This I learned without warning. Holding my brow. In time he thought I would kill him. Oh but I didn't know how. I said it's your god I don't believe in. No your Bible can't be true. Knocked down by the long life. He cried 'I fear what waits for you'. I can hear those bells. Spoken and gone. I feel relief I feel well. Now he knows he was wrong. I am cold for my father. Frozen underground. Jesus I wouldn't bother. He belongs to me now. Something sad keeps moving. So I wandered around. I fell in love with the burden. Holding me down. Bless my mind I miss. Being told how to live. What I learned without knowing. How much more that I owe that I can give. This is how I tell it. Oh but it's long. One Sunday morning. One son is gone
3585,You can dance through the night. Rock n roll music itching to fight. Makin love drunk or stoned. Lookin for dollars. Get broken-boned. It's a game too tough to tame. Ends up the same.

3603,Touched the mirror. Broke the surface of the water. Saw my true self. All illusions shattered. Money's only paper only ink. We'll destroy ourselves if we can't agree. How the world turns. Who made the sun. Who owns the sea. The world we know will fall piece by piece. Sat down up close to the colored black hole. Like they'd always told me not to. Saw the one dimension polka dot pacifier. And all illusions shattered. Money's only paper only ink. We'll destroy ourselves if we can't agree. How the world turns. Who made the sun. Who owns the sea. The world we know will fall piece by piece. Bared myself wholly heart and body unadorned. Stripped down solely. To the evil and the good. Felt no shame. Naked to the world. And all illusions shattered. Money's only paper only ink. We'll destroy ourselves if we can't agree. How the world turns. Who made the sun. Who owns the sea. The world we know will fall piece by piece. Faced towards the sea. Looked to heaven up above. Felt the world revolve around me. No one could tell me otherwise. But the turbulent waters won't reflect this life. Only the sun the moon and sky. And all illusions shattered. Money's only paper only ink. We'll destroy ourselves if we can't agree. How the world turns. Who made the sun. Who owns the sea. The world we know will fall piece by piece. Money's only paper only ink

3669,Farewell heartless world. I'll send you a postcard burnt. in the flames you've tried so hard. To extinguish with fear of failing. I'll write down everything I have learned. And edit it down to a single word. Love for you I've waiting anticipating. Sparks will fly beneath the luna alight. Lazarus and Frankenstein's. Baby I'll be a flatliner for a heart killer. A little we die above the lesser light. For you I'm open wide. Baby I'll be a flatliner for a heart killer. Heart killer. Top hats up to the return. Of the beat to lick a wound to. Cursed for some and blessed for a few. It doesn't have to make any sense at all. Come hither and we'll fall. In love for love. I'm crawling out of patience baby. Sparks will fly beneath the luna alight. Lazarus and Frankensteins. Baby I'll be a flatliner for a heart killer. A little we die above the lesser light. For you I'm open wide. Baby I'll be a flatliner for a heart killer. Paint all your sorrow for me to sing. Heartkiller. Draw your pain and hear me hum it out. Sparks will fly beneath the luna alight. Lazarus and Frankenstein's. Baby I'll be a flatliner for a heart killer. A little we die above the lesser light. For you I'm open wide. Baby I'll be a flatliner for a heart killer. Heart killer. Heart killer. Heart killer. Baby I'll be a flatliner for a heart killer. Baby I'll be a flatliner for a heart killer
3672,Want it. You can have it. Come and take it. I don't need it. Power and possessions. Never quiet your obsessions. Outside we search for something. Inside we still have nothing. People deep in trouble. Let their money run for double. Outside they search for something. Inside they still have nothing. It never ends. There's nothing I can do. There's nothing I can say. And even if I could. And even if I would. It never goes away. Yeah. Heartless rich and greedy. Watch the churches rape the needy. While we pray for salvation. Preachers yield to temptation. It never ends. There's nothing I can do. There's nothing I can say. And even if I could. And even if I would. It never goes away. There's nothing I can do. There's nothing I can say. And even if I could. And even if I would. It never goes away. Blinded believers and doomsday deceivers. Are driving you out of your head. Look in the mirror the answer is near. Though your sanity hangs by a thread. There's nothing I can do. There's nothing I can say. And even I could. And even I would. It never goes away. There's nothing I can do. There's nothing I can say And even if I could. And even if I would. It never goes away.
3673,There's a MKII parked on the cobbles. Of a Chelsea Mews and out of the shadows. Steps a figure silver mohair bright. Into the moonshine out in to the night. And in the darkness one stray moonbeam. Creeps through the curtains on the unmade bed. She stares at the ceiling just an empty feeling. He starts the Jaguar and drives away. And no one breathes a word. Cos even breathing can be heard. Right through the silver screen. They've made inquiries they'll make it easy. But she won't answer cos she's not really there. He throws his gloves out the open window. He lights a cigarette and drives away. He starts the Jaguar and drives away.....
3674,Who would have thought that you could hurt me. The way you've done it. So deliberate so determined. Since you have been gone. I bite my nails for days and hours. And question my own questions on and on. Tell me now tell me now. Why you're so far away. When I'm still so close. You don't even know the meaning of the words. I'm sorry. You said you would love me until you die. As far as I know you're still alive. Baby. You don't even know the meaning of the words. I'm sorry. I'm starting to believe it should be illegal. to deceive a woman's heart. I tried so hard to be attentive. To all you wanted always supportive. always patient. What did I do wrong?. I'm wondering for days and hours. it's here it isn't here where you belong. Anyhow Anyhow. I wish you both all the best. I hope you get along. You don't even know the meaning of the words. I'm sorry. You said you would love me until you die. As far as I know you're still alive. Baby. You don't even know the meaning of the words. I'm sorry. I'm starting to believe it should be illegal. to deceive a woman's heart. You don't even know the meaning of the words. I'm sorry. You said you would love me until you die. As far as I know you're still alive. Baby. You don't even know the meaning of the words. I'm sorry. I'm starting to believe it should be illegal. to deceive a woman's heart. Open heart open heart... it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart. Open heart open heart... it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart

Oh today I shot Ramona Ma. She ain't gonna cheat on me. Two years I've been searchin' for her. Two years she's been free. Well I'm writing you this letter from Laredo.

Then love love will tear us apart. again [x4]. Why is the bedroom so cold. Turned away on your side?. Is my timing that flawed. our respect run so dry?. Yet there's still this appeal. That we've kept through. our lives. Love love will tear us apart again [x4]. Do you cry out in your sleep. All my failings expose?. Get a taste in my mouth. As desperation takes hold. Is it something so good. Just can't function no more?. When love

3685,Instead of cursing the darkness. Light a candle for where we're goin'. There's something ahead worth looking for.. When the light of time is on us. We will see our moment come. and the living soul inside will carry on.. It's a chance to give new meaning. to every move we make. Through the caverns in the caves. where we come from.. When the light of dawn is on us. We will see what we can be. and the ancient ones can sleep an easy sleep.. In the hallways of the ages. on the road to history. What we do now will always be with us. It's a chance to give new meaning. to every move we make. In the caverns in the caves. where we come from.. Instead of cursing the darkness. Light a candle for where we're goin'. There's something ahead worth looking for.. When the light of time is on us. We will see our moment come. and the living soul inside will carry on.. Light a candle in the darkness. so others might see ahead. Light a candle in the darkness when you go.

3688,Come with me my little innocents there's a game that we can play. See how much we can change your world while you look the other way. Turn around as if to see if you can catch us cheat. And all you'll find are shining presents laid down at your feet. Take the bait take the bait. Television is flash and Coke is nice and you can have the rest. Dream those dreams you've always had of wealth and power and sex. We'll run your mines your factories and we'll take our little toll. And you can have these missiles too while we maintain control. Chorus:. Creeping creeping footsteps around the world. While they promise us everything we've ever wanted. Hush now don't you cry don't you realise your crime?. Like lambs go to the slaughterhouse we know our rights from wrongs. But we go down to the shopping mall with 30 silver coins. And somewhere out in South America where the forests lie in ruin. They shout - we'd better get these natives some clothes. Because their videos are coming in soon. Chorus:. Creeping creeping footsteps around the world.

3692,There's just two ways to lose yourself in this life. And neither way is safe. In my dreams I see visions of the future. But today we have today. And where will I find You?. Where will I find You?. In the economy of mercy. I am a poor and begging man. In the currency of grace. Is where my song begins. In the colors of Your goodness. In the scars that mark Your skin. In the currency of grace. Is where my song begins. These carbon shells. These fragile dusty frames. House canvases of souls. We are bruised and broken masterpieces. But we did not paint ourselves. And where will I find You?. Where was I when the world was made?. Where was I?. I'm lost without You here. Yes I'm lost without You near. I'm lost without You here. You knew my name when the world was made

3697,"""Grandpa here's your coffee"". said Edith as she filled his cup. ""Nobody'll find you here. and Earl is glad you guys showed up"". "" The way things are downtown. you might have to stay for awhile. There was a helicopter hovering over your house. when I talked to your neighbor Kyle"". ""Who the hell do they think they are. Invading our home like that?. Grandma and I had to leave so fast. We couldn't even catch the cat"". ""The helicopter scared the shit out of him. and it took off down a trail. down past the railroad track. towards the county jail"". ""Jed you really screwed up now!. What did you have to do that for?. Everybody wants to hang your ass. and here's a note from Lenore"". Sun touched the cold steel bars. as she pushed the paper in. Jed took it up and read it. and he couldn't hide a grin. Outside the jail window. a crow flew across the sky. completely disappearing behind each bar. then a helicopter flew by. ""Say hi to Earl and Edith. Tell 'm I'm doing fine. Tell 'm it's time for them to let you go now. they should cut the line"". ""Can grandma come and see me?. I got a new song to sing. it's longer than all the others combined. and it doesn't mean a thing"". The noise was unfamiliar. generators whirling. walkie-talkies screaming. vans parked in the open field. TV crews and cameras. they wanted to interview grandpa on the porch. They came through the gate and across the lawn. knocking down Edith's Tiki Torch. And grandpa saw them there. looking through the venetian blind. ""Those people don't have any respect. so they won't get any of mine"". ""I don't wanna talk about Jed. I don't watch channel 2 or 6 or 9. I don't have time to talk that fast. and it ain't my crime"". ""It ain't a privilege to be on TV. and it ain't a duty either. The only good thing about TV. is shows like 'Leave it to Beaver"". ""Shows with love and affection'. like mama used to say. A little Mayberry living. could go a long way"". He took Earl's shotgun down from the closet. loaded up both barrels. Walked out on the porch and fired 'm off. and up walked a woman named Carol. ""Susan Carol from Early Magazine. I got some questions to ask"". ""Well you can stick 'm where the sun don't shine! "". grandpa said with a gasp. Then he fell face first and let out a sigh. and Edith ran out in shock. He was looking at her from down on the floor. Grandpa looked like he was trying to talk. ""That guy just keeps singin'!. Can somebody shut him up?. I don't know for the life of me. where he comes up with that stuff. "". They laid his head on a newspaper. with a picture of Carmichael on the front page. posing with the little league baseball team. and a seedy shot of Jed on a motorcycle. Grandpa died a hero. Trying to stop the media. Fighting for freedom of silence. Trying to be anonymous. Share your loving and you live so long. Share your loving and you live so long. Share your loving and you live so long"

3705,I do not love youIsabella. I never have I never will. I saunter through this ceremony. Confidence high enthusiasm nil. My reasoning need not detain you. But woman it's not all bad news. Very few find peace and succour. In the spouse or life that they choose. He will crush you. Has no pity. Wave on wave on wave of grief. I shall love him. Understand him. That he loves me is my belief. I do not need you Isabella. If I did we'd not be here. We'd be in some lovers' heaven. Our way ahead and dreams so clear. I welcome you into my family. Into it's dark internal wars. Let me enter into battle. I have the will I have the cause. No-one leaves him. But they're damaged. And stripped of every vestige of good. Is he man or. Is he devil?. I see but dread the likelihood. I shall not stay poor Isabella. So never heed my marriage vow. Believe in time you won't regret this. Thought it may disturb you now. Abandon all attempts to love me. Don't fool yourself that's what you feel. When you at last decide to hate me. At least your emotion will be real. Wolfish savage. Tuned to madness. Love is stifled joy denied. I do hate him. I am wretched. A cold contaminated bride. Isabella! Isabella!. I do not love you Isabella. I never have I never will. I saunter through this ceremony. Confidence high enthusiasm nil. My reasoning need not detain you. But woman it's not all bad news. very few find peace and succour. In the spouse or life that they choose. Isabella!. Isabella!

3715,Ooooh. Ooooh. Stop don't. I don't wanna hear anymore. I can't focus with all this loud noise. You say one thing but to the other. Your words are twisted right as they slip from your mouth. Why are so confusing?. How do you sleep knowing your love is. Drowning me. The waters too high I can't see. You're drowning me. Your waves are just too much to take. I can't breathe. I've gotta find my way out baby. Your love is killing me. Ooooooh. You try to hide it but I see. You're not who you used to be. Your eyes have slowly become a blank stare. You don't know what's wrong. All you know is that you simply don't care. Why do you always pull away from me?. How can I stay when your love is. Drowning me. The waters too high I can't see. You're drowning me. Your waves are just too much to take. I can't breathe. I gotta find my way out baby. Your love is killing me. Your love is calling me pushing me down. Your love is changing me and it's changed you somehow. Your love is making me wanna run from you. Our love is sinking and I'm done trying to save you. Drowning me. The waters too high I can't see. You're drowning me. Your waves are just too much to take. I can't breathe. I've gotta find my way out baby. Your love is killing me. Drowning me. The waters too high I can't see. You're drowning me.

3716,Company always on the run. Destiny is a rising sun. I was born six gun in my hand. Behind the gun I make my final stand. That's why they call me. Bad company I can't deny. Bad bad company. 'Til the day I die. Rebel souls deserters we are called. Chose a gun and threw away the sword. Now these towns they all know our names. Six gun sound is our claim to fame. I can hear 'em say.

3717,When red is black and petals blue. And in my sleepless head our love's been dead a week or two. Sometimes good times are stuck inside of you. And then they're gone. But I don't know why. A lot of things have changed since you said goodbye. There are reasons for you to love me. But I gave you none. So I turn my glass and nod my chin. And wonder who you've been in rhythm with. Sometimes just time cause can't escape. Clouds are playing close not often too far away. Blue has no value power over you. Open skies will grace your lip. Carelessness is what I miss. And that's how I think of you. Sometimes good times are all we have to do. So I turn my glass and nod my chin. And wonder who you've been in rhythm with. So I turn my glass and nod my chin. And wonder who you've been in rhythm with.
3718,They couldn't see what I though would be so obvious. They hide behind the laws that they make for all of. us. The ministry of truth that deals with pretense. The ministry of peace that sits on defense. I'm washing my hands of what they're tryin' to do. I'm breaking the rules and its for me and for you. I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel. I'll tell you no lies. They think I worship the devil. They only see through his eyes. I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel. They live their lives in fear and insecurity. And all you do is pay for their prosperity. The ministry of fear that won't let you live. The ministry of grace that doesn't forgive. Do what you will to try and make me conform. But I'll make you wish that you had never been born. Cause I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel. I'll do as I please. I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel. I'm as free as the breeze. I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel. They'll try playin with your heart. The know it rules you head. They only feel what bigotry feels. They won't fool with me again (oh no). . God only knows why they couldn't see the obvious. Is it because that they manifest the incubus. The ministry of war that got caught in the draught. The ministry of joy that still hasn't laughed. When it's all boiled down and the days at an end. I'll give you no bullshit and I'll never pretend. Cause I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel. I'll tell you no lies. They say I worship the Devil. Why don't they open their eyes....I'm just etc..
3719,Staring out at the rain with a heavy heart. It's the end of the world in my mind. Then your voice pulls me back like a wake up call. I've been looking for the answer somewhere. I couldn't see that it was right there. But now I know what I didn't know. Because you live and breathe. Because you make me believe in myself. When nobody else can help. Because you live girl. My world has twice as many stars in the sky. It's allright I survived I'm alive again. Cause of you made it through every storm. What is life what's the use if you're killing time. I'm so glad I've found an angel. Someone who was there when all my hopes fell. I wanna fly looking in your eyes. Because you live and breathe. Because you make me believe in myself. When nobody else can help. Because you live girl. My world has twice as many stars in the sky. Because you live I live. Because you live there's a reason why. I carry on when I lose the fight. I want to give what you've given me always. Because you live and breathe. Because you make me believe in myself. When nobody else can help. Because you live girl. My world has twice as many stars in the sky. Because you live and breathe. Because you make me believe in myself. When nobody else can help. Because you live girl. My world has everything I need to survive. Because you live. I live. I live
3720,Now lay me down on market street. I’m lookin’ for some spare change. A coast guard ship has been lookin’ for me. And I might have to change my name. Here comes Uncle Sam again with the same old bag of beans. The local chief’s on the radio. He’s got some hungry mouths to feed. Goin back to Alcatraz. Lay me back down here on the highway.

3722,I haven't fucked much with the past but I've fucked plenty with the future.. Over the skin of silk are scars from the splinters of stations and walls I've caressed.. A stage is like each bolt of wood like a log of Helen is my pleasure.. I would measure the success of a night by the way by the way by the amount of piss and seed I could exude over the columns that. nestled the P.A.. Some nights I'd surprise everybody by skipping off with a skirt of green net sewed over with flat metallic circles which dazzled and. flashed.. The lights were violet and white. I had an ornamental veil but I couldn't bear to use it.. When my hair was cropped I craved covering but now my hair itself is a veil and the scalp inside is a scalp of a crazy and sleepy. Comanche lies beneath this netting of the skin.. I wake up. I am lying peacefully I am lying peacefully and my knees are open to the sun.. I desire him and he is absolutely ready to seize me. In heart I am a Moslem; in heart I am an American;. In heart I am Moslem in heart I'm an American artist and I have no guilt.. I seek pleasure. I seek the nerves under your skin.. The narrow archway; the layers; the scroll of ancient lettuce.. We worship the flaw the belly the belly the mole on the belly of an exquisite whore.. He spared the child and spoiled the rod. I have not sold myself to God.

Who are you gonna be when there's nobody there?. Who are you today?. 'Cause I am still the same. Monday you had my heart. Tuesday you had me screaming. Wednesday we didn't part.

Can make you feel so right and bring you so much pain. It's so strange how the same face. Can make you love until it hurts. Where do we go?. I need to know. Who are you today?. Will you be the sun or the pouring rain?. Who are you tomorrow?. Will you make me smile or just bring me sorrow?. Who are you gonna be when I'm lost and I'm scared?. Who are you gonna be when there's nobody there?. Who are you today. 'Cause I am still the same

I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go. If you don't know yourself. If you don't know yourself. It's bad for your health.
3761,Will you stick to me?. 'Cause I will stick to you.. I'll be the sticker on your refrigerator. I'll be the sticker on your mirror.. High marks in German and high marks in Spanish.. I could bet that I could learn the language. That you speak and learn to speak it well once. I said you should not take me for granted. Well now that was just I lie.. Because I will love you 'til the day that I die.. Lilly I love you. I’ve made my journey from Marilyn to Madonna. And I came to the conclusion that none of these. Can compete with you.. You’ve made your journey from. Patrick Swayze to Mikkelsen. And you came to the conclusion when it’s dark. I look just as good.. Lilly I love you.. Lilly. Lilly I love you so much. Once I said you should not take me for granted. Well now that was just I lie.. Because I will love you 'til the day that I die.. Lilly I love you
3762,Midnight that old clock keeps ticking. The kids are all asleep and I'm walking the floor. Darlin' I can see that you're dreaming. And I don't wanna wake you up. When I close the door. This old house of ours is built on dreams. And a businessman don't know what that means. There's a garden outside she works in every day. And tomorrow morning a man from the bank's. Gonna come and take it all away. Lately I've been thinking 'bout daddy. And how he always made things work. when the chips were down. And I know I've got something inside me. There's always a light there to guide me. To what can't be found. This old house of ours is built on dreams. And a businessman don't know what that means. There's a swing outside the kids play on every day. And tomorrow morning a man from the bank's. Gonna come and take it all away. Take it all away take it all away take it all away. Take it all away take it all away take it all away. Remember how we first came here together?. Standing on an empty lot holding hands. Later we came back in the moonlight. And made love right where the kitchen is. Then we made our plans. This old house of ours is built on dreams. And a businessman don't know what that means. There's a garden outside she works in every day. And tomorrow morning a man from the bank's. Gonna come and take it all away. Take it all away take it all away take it all away. Take it all away take it all away take it all away

3767,Watch for vipers and poison snakes. Feeling fingers make no mistake. Grabbing that pull your hair. Stealing everything there everything. . Restless widow in the dark. Carelessly looks for a spark. Near the trap fate rears its head. No hesitation victim dead. Just from the start it's the end. . And it's all the same in the end. It's all the same in the end. . Spider moving up your wall. To the celling he slowly crawls. Weaves a web above your bed. Egg that cracks falls on your head. And it's all the same. It's all the same. No hesitation victim dead. Just from the start it's the end. . No wrong no right or guilt admission. It's all the same. You've been bitten you've been bitten
3768,I'm an accident. I was driving way too fast. Couldn't stop though. So I let the moment last. I'm for rollin'. I'm for tossin' in my sleep. It's not guilt though. It's not the company I keep. People my age. They don't do the things I do. They go somewhere. While I run away with you. I got my friends. And I got my children too. I got her love. She's got my love too. I can't hear you. But I feel the things you say. I can't see you. But I see what's in my way. Now I'm floatin'. Cause I'm not tied to the ground. Words I've spoken. Seem to leave a hollow sound. On the long plain. See the rider in the night. See the chieftain. See the braves in cool moonlight. Who will love them. When they take another life. Who will hold them. When they tremble for the knife. Voicemail numbers. On an old computer screen. Rows of lovers. Parked forever in a dream. Screaming sirens. Echoing across the bay. To the old boats. From the city far away. Homeless heroes. Walk the streets of their hometown. Rows of zeros. On a field that's turning brown. They play baseball. They play football under lights. They play card games. And we watch them every night. Need distraction. Need romance and candlelight. Need random violence. Need entertainment tonight. Need the evidence. Want the testimony of. Expert witnesses. On the brutal crimes of love. I was too tired. To see the news when I got home. Pulled the curtain. Fell into bed alone. Started dreaming. Saw the rider once again. In the doorway. Where she stood and watched for him. Watched for him. I'm not present. I'm a drug that makes you dream. I'm an aerostar. I'm a cutlass supreme. In the wrong lane. Trying to turn against the flow. I'm the ocean. I'm the giant undertow. I'm the ocean. I'm the ocean. I'm the giant undertow. I'm the ocean. I'm the giant undertow. I'm the ocean. I'm the ocean. I'm the ocean. I'm the ocean. I'm the ocean. I'm the ocean
3770,Swim the river when the bridge is gone. I got the fever and I'm comin on. feel the power in my flesh and bone. through the fire and the fallen stone. Up the alley and the dirty back roads. all the places that nobody knows. got to make it just another mile. gonna be there in a little while. If the end has come. If the end has come. If the end has come. I want to be by your side. River burning and the trees are dyin'. tearing open with an angry sign. hands they tremble and hearts they race. I won't rest until I see your face. Coming for you in the blazing night. hold your body in the fading light. I'll beg and steal if that's what it takes. I may stumble but I will not break. If the end has come. If the end has come. If the end has come. I want to be by your side. Through the tunnel on my hands and knees. people crying and they're begging please. feel the power in my flesh and bone. through the fire and the fallen stone. All the places that nobody knows. up the alley and the dirty back roads. got to make it just another mile. got to be there in a little while. Coming for you in the blazing night. hold your body in the fading light. rivers burning and the trees are dyin'. tearing open with an angry sign. Walls may crumble and the ground may shake. I'll beg and steal if that's what it takes. hands they tremble and hearts they race. I won't rest until I see your face. If the end has come. If the end has come. If the end has come. I want to be by your side. If the end has come. If the end has come. If the end has come. I want to be by your side
3772,Have seen them raise an eye I'm comin' home. Seedy and crawlin' seven years or more. Now you know where I'm goin'. A beautiful shade of blue and pale. A colour you bought at a junkie's yard sale. Stop your cryin' stop your cryin'. Well I'm lazy now-the summer crazy farm. Is all I own with. My motor my thrills I needed my space. My prison my drugs let's go to my place. Ain't been there lately. Ain't been there lately. Ain't been there lately - there's no room. Well I sacrificed the all the people.

Drop on by now let's get high now. The reverend reminded me your redemption can be paid with. My motor my thrills I needed my space. My prison my drugs let's go to my place. Ain't been there lately. Ain't been there lately. Ain't been there lately-there's no room. Ain't been there lately. Ain't been there lately. Ain't been there lately. Ain't been there lately lately

3775,Shut up sweetheart I want you to hear. I can no longer love the same thing I fear. I can no longer let myself stay close. To the one thing that hurts me the most. I will not kiss the thorn. Hearts don't need to bleed to know what they're for. There'll be no more heartaches. There'll be no more heartaches for me. I take back my sweetness. It's overlooked by your lust. My song is unseen. cause your touch is too tough. I don't think your hands know how to adore. The subtlety of me anymore. I unfasten myself from your side. Slip away quiet as a sigh. There'll be no more heartaches. There'll be no more heartaches for me. can't you see  can't you see  can't you see what you love has done to me. I need you to know  you gotta know you gotta let me go.. Beds filled with suspicion. Hearts filled with spite. We sleep with thieves. And forego our sights. Too quick to hold. someone's word over our own. You may be cool. You may know how to flatter. In the end (all I have is matter (?)). There'll be no more heartaches. There'll be no more heartaches. No more heartache anymore. anymore oh oh oh for me.
3776,Some sweet day some sweet day. I'm gonna hold you like I want to. I'm gonna kiss you like I want to. I'm gonna love you like I need to. Some sweet day. Some sweet day you will say. That you have started dreaming of me. That you love no one else above me. I'll find a way to make you love me. Some sweet day. I hope it won't be long. Till I can take you and make you my very own. Cause can't you see I get so tired. Of wishing and dreaming alone. Some sweet day some sweet day. You'll get that twinkle in your eye love. You're gonna look at me and sigh love. And then you tell me that you're my love. Some sweet day. Some sweet day some sweet day. You'll get that twinkle in your eye love. You're gonna look at me and sigh love. And then you tell me that you're my love. Some sweet day

And I was thinking clearly. Now I'm like a bee. And I'm huntin' for the honey. And I'm kinda shy but. You're super fly. I could be your kryptonite. Oh. Light my heart up baby. Like a matchstick. Oh.

3778,Both hands together. Put your face down on the floor!. Just kick your gun and. Don't you dare to run!. (Chorus). Hands on the wall!!. Distressing call. Just after violence. comes the dead and final ending of hope. Is it for God?. Is it for God?. To be the one in this world alone. Swept the room to find some peace and. The Meaning for this fearful war. Growing down the road. Both hands together. Put your face down on the floor!. Just kick your gun and. Don't you dare to run!. (Chorus). Hands on the wall!!. Distressing call. Just after violence. comes the dead and final ending of hope. Is it for God?. Is it for God?. Deceiving hope closing doors. Building walls all over me. The more I wait the more I long. to end this day and start again. Embrace this hollow world.... Both hands together. Put your face down on the floor!. Just kick your gun and. Don't you.... Don`t you forget about your dark past!. (Chorus). Hands on the wall!!. Distressing call. Just after violence. comes the dead and final ending of hope. Is it for God?. Is it for God?. The fate of all. Is save the world. From all the human race. Compel to live. Under an alias. For all the days. Of this endless life. Betraying our cause. Displaying guns and flaws. (Chorus). Hands on the wall!!. Distressing call. Just after violence. comes the dead and final ending of hope. Is it for God?. Is it for God?
3779,Wake up to a cloudy day. Dark rolls in and it starts to rain. Staring out to the cage-like walls. Time goes by and the shadows crawl. Crushin' Candy Crush-ing pills. Got no job mom pays my bills. Textin' Nexus get my feels. Sweatin' bullets Netflix-chills. World's out there singin' the blues. Twenty more dead on the evening news. Think to myself: Really what's the use?. I'm just like you I was born to lose. Why oh why can't you just fix me?. When all I want's to feel numb. But the medication's all gone. Why oh why does God hate me?. When all I want's to get high. And forget this so-called life. I am so frickin' bored. Nothing to do today. I guess I'll sit around and medicate. (I medicate). I am so frickin' bored. Nothing to do today. I guess I'll sit around and medicate. (I medicate). Can't wait to feel better than I ever will. Attack that shit like a kid on Benadryl. Chase it down with a hopeful smile. Hate myself if I can go for miles. They say family is all you need. Someone to trust can help you breathe. Inhale that drug but you start to choke. You follow the outs of an inside joke. Why oh why can't you just fix me?. When all I want's to feel numb. But the medication's all gone. Why oh why does God hate me?. Cause I've seen enough of it. heard enough of it felt enough of it. I've had enough of it. I am so frickin' bored. Nothing to do today. I guess I'll sit around and medicate. (I medicate). I am so frickin' bored. Nothing to do today. I guess I'll sit around and medicate. Medicate. Medicate. Medicate. Medicate. Superman is a hero. But only when his mind is clear though. He needs that fix like the rest of us. So he's got no fear when he saves that bus. All the stars in the Hollywood Hills. Snapchat Live while they pop them pills. All those flavors of the rainbow. Too bad that shit don't work though. Your friends are high right now. Your parents are high right now. That hot chick's high right now. That cop is high right now. The president's high right now. Your priest is high right now. Everyone's high as fuck right now. And no one's ever coming down. I am so frickin' bored. Nothing to do today. I guess I'll sit around and medicate. (I medicate). I am so frickin' bored. Nothing to do today. I guess I'll sit around and medicate. Medicate. Medicate. Medicate. Medicate. I medicate
3780,The bias of the father runs on through the son. And leaves him bothered and bewildered. The drugs in his veins only cause him to spit. At the face staring back in the mirror. How can he tell a good act from the bad. He can't even remember his name. How can he do what needs to be done. When he's a follower not a leader. The sickness of the mother runs on through the girl. Leaving her small and helpless. Liquor files through her brain with the force of a gun. Leaving her running in circles. How can she tell a good act from the bad. When she's flat on her back in her room. How can she do what needs to be done. When she's a coward and a bleeder. The man if he marries will batter his child. And have endless excuses. The woman sadly will do much the same. Thinking that it's right and it's proper. Better than their mommy or their daddy did. Better than the childhood they suffered. The truth is they're happier when they're in pain. In fact that's why they got married.
3781,Yeah sing the song Bro'. If the sun refuse to shine. I don't mind I don't mind. If the mountains fell in the sea. let it be it ain't me.. Alright 'cos I got my own world to look through. And I ain't gonna copy you.. Now if 6 turned out to be 9. I don't mind I don't mind. Alright if all the hippies cut off all their hair. I don't care I don't care.. Dig 'cos I got my own world to live through. And I ain't gonna copy you.. White collared conservative flashing down the street. Pointing their plastic finger at me.. They're hoping soon my kind will drop and die. But I'm gonna wave my freak flag high high.. Wave on wave on. Fall mountains just don't fall on me. Go ahead on Mr. Business man you can't dress like me.. Sing on Brother play on drummer.
3782,She's on her own. Wonderin' if he misbehaves. While he's out at sea. Lost in the ocean waves. She doesn't know. If his boat will ever show. That's why I'm gonna say to you. My dear. Before my lips turn blue. I'll say to you. Before you go. Don't you know. That it's me and it's you. I know what they've done and I know what they're comin' to do. So don't pretend. That you know.

3785,"The 90s. Picking up the story. from where I left off. It's 1990 now. So school can fu.ck off. I got no GCSEs. nothing higher than a 'D'. I couldn't tell me Mum. because she'd batter me. Me and Tate sat on the bowling green. Life was a sh.itter. We had five quid between us. And bought us six cans of bitter. I took me ten Benson home. And I smoked through the sorrow. If I could just avoid me Mum. Maybe I'd tell her tomorrow. I stumbled through the door. I said Mum it's like this. She said ""That man's been on the phone. And you've made the list. You're in that boy band son. Come and giz' us a kiss"". Phoned up Martin and Rich. And carried on getting pissed. Boys I don't believe it. I'm gonna be famous. Pick you up in a Porsche. and buy you lots of trainers. I met the other guys. one seemed like a cock. I think it's going to be like New Kids On The Block. I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy. (I only wanted to get down). I hate those that hate me. I can't forgive and it's crazy. Baby. Now I'm a video star. (I'm making trouble in this town). Do you know who you are?. (For the five of us). Baby. I adopted four brothers. Some I liked more than others. One was like a brother from another mother. But the lead singer made it hard to like him. And I still loved him. despite him. The first three months. you know I nearly quit. I played snooker with my Dad. he said ""Don't be a dick. Unload the bullets. you're mind is a gun. You're gonna shoot yourself when they're number one"". I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy. (I only wanted to get down). I hate those that hate me. I can't forgive and it's crazy. Baby. Now I'm a video star. (I'm making trouble in this town). Do you know who you are. (For the five of us). Baby. Now it's dinner with Versace. And lunch with Princess Diana. And I'm gonna get belted if I go out of my manor. Cause as much as we were loved. We were also hated. The boys got jealous. Cause the girls got plated. And now we're famous and that. and we're dancing and that. And I'm thinking I can sing. why am I stood at the back. So fu.ck the band. give me Sambuka and gak. Now we're all a bag of nerves. Were not a band of brothers. . I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy. (I only wanted to get down). I hate those that hate me. I can't forgive and it's crazy. Baby. Now I'm a video star. (I'm making trouble in this town). Do you know who you are?. (For the five of us). Baby. And now it's breaking my heart. because the dream's turned to sh.it. It ain't broke but I'll break it in a little bit. And I'm always in trouble. but I've stopped saying sorry. Everybody's worried. What the fu.ck's wrong with Robbie. He's not answering his phone. He's not talking to me. I saw him on the telly at Glastonbury. And now I'm running away. from everything that I've been. And I'm pissed and I'm fu.cked. and I'm only nineteen. I can't conform no more. I can't perform no more. . But the boys know I'm fu.cked. and so they show me the door. And if the truth be told. I wasn't fit enough to stay. So I put my head down. and walked away. That was the 90's. 90 to 95. I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy. (I only wanted to get down). I hate those that hate me. I can't forgive and it's crazy. Baby. Now I'm a video star. (I'm making trouble in this town). Do you know who you are. (For the five of us). Baby"
3787,Oh! Gravity. There's a fracture in the color bar. In the backseat of a parked car. By the liquor store where the streetlight. Keep you company til the next night. In the same town there's the same scar. In the same glow of the liquor store. By the freeway where the headlight. Keep her company til the next night. (chorus). Oh! Gravity!. Why can't we seem to keep it together?. Sons of my enemies. Why can't we seem to keep it together?. In the back room of the pentagon. There's a thin man with a line drawn. With a red jaw and a red bite. Watch the headline on the next night. (chorus). Oh! Gravity!. Why can't we seem to keep it together?. Sons of my enemies. Why can't we seem to keep it together?. Why this tragedy?. Why can't we seem to keep it together?. Oh! Gravity!. Why can't we seem to pull it together?. In the fallout the fallout. We found out the hype won't get you through. We're connected connected. I meant it the hype won't get you through
3788,To me you are the loveliest thing I've seen all day. You can't take that away. No you can't take that away. All my life I wondered why it couldn't be this way. That was up until today. Oh it had to be this way. Today wait until the morning comes. Before you slip away. Without permission. Without suspicion. Without permission given. You seem to have a friendlier smile than all the rest. Well I looked and you were best. Yeah i've looked at all the rest. You can't imagine passionate words that I would say. If only you would stay. Oh you know you gotta stay. Today wait until the morning comes. Before you slip away. Without permission. Without suspicion. Without permission given. You used to be and early bird. But how was I to know you would leave without shedding a tear. I only want to love you. I'll make a wish and suddenly I'm glad that I have you here. Oh I'm glad I have you here. Today. To me you are the loveliest thing I've seen all day. And you can't take that away. No you can't take that away. All my life I wondered why it couldn't be this way. That was up until today. Yeah it had to be this way. Today wait until the morning comes. Before you slip away today. Before you slip away. Without permission. Without suspicion.
3789,And when the world began. I'd been asleep forever. I opened one eye. 'Twas then it was I. Got the whim to wake. And when the weight of space. Rolled like it was an ocean. One became one. Father and son. Watched the sunrise break. And as the ocean warmed. And from this dream we woke. One sang to greet the dawn. One pursed his lips and spoke. Wake up and hear the music. Wake up and hear the music play. Wake up and hear the music. Wake up and hear what the people say. I heard the heavens sing. Predicting Marty Robbins. I knew I'd find. Music and time. Were the perfect plan. I watched my son sail on. A little ship a-bobbin'. I had to grow. I needed to know. Exactly who I am. And as the ocean warmed. And from this dream we woke. One sang to greet the dawn. One pursed his lips and spoke. Wake up and hear the music. Wake up and hear the music play. Wake up and hear the music. Wake up and hear what the people say. Wake up and hear the music. Wake up and hear the music play. Wake up and hear the music. Wake up and hear what the people say
3790,"We've been through some things together. With trunks of memories still to come. We found things to do in stormy weather. Long may you run.. Long may you run.. Long may you run.. Although these changes have come. With your chrome heart shining in the sun. Long may you run.. Well it was back in Blind River in 1962. When I last saw you alive. But we missed that shift on the long decline. Long may you run.. Long may you run.. Long may you run.. Although these changes have come. With your chrome heart shining in the sun. Long may you run.. Maybe The Beach Boys have got you now. With those waves singing ""Caroline No"". Rollin' down that empty ocean road. Gettin' to the surf on time.. Long may you run.. Long may you run.. Although these changes have come. With your chrome heart shining in the sun. Long may you run.."
3791,I've been down this road before. Now I'm coming back for more. This is like a déjà vu I was born to be with you. Into the night we went to sleep. You and I were meant for keeps. Into the night we went to play you and I. I really hope you'll always be so in love with me. I really hope we'll always stay so attached this way. So beware of the pitfall. We don't have to change at all. And our light will not burn out. It's what freedom's all about. Into the night we'll go to sleep. You and I are meant for keeps. Into the night we'll go to play. You and I. I really hope you'll always be so in love with me. I really hope we'll always stay so attached this way. I really hope you'll always be so in love with me. I really hope we'll always stay so attached this way. I really hope that we'll always be here. I really hope that you'll always be near. Take me and break me I'll always be here. I really hope that you'll always be near
3793,I got these feelings I try to bury down. But they keep screamin'. And I'm just tryin' to filter out somehow. But they don't wanna leave. No you don't need it. All the jealousy and ugly feelings. Left from my history I try so hard. But they get the best of me. And you got every reason to walk out the door. But you rather be next to me. All the voices in my head. Always try to break me. Fuck me up and change me. But talking is cheap. This is the last time. I listen to the voices in my head. I know (I know) they never stop talking. Always sabotaging. But talking is cheap.

3796,I am looking up at the clouds. watching the world spin around. Something looks familiar in the color of the sky. Reminds me of the mess that I made last night. It's blue as the ocean as wild as the tide. I'm home. In your arms is where I belong. Please don't let me go. Thank God I'm finally home. Here I go again where I haven't been now for a while. It feels so damn good to let out the smile. Can't remember the last time I felt loved. When your skin touched mine. Somehow I feel so strong. when I look into your eyes and look into your soul. If you're not holding me I can't breath. I'd rather die. I'm home. In your arms is where I belong. Please don't let me go

3802,Presidents and peace spreading poets. Getting gunned down in the streets. Shown to us on our prime time screens. For our tea time treat. Lunatics we voted for denying. Everything that they swore. We sit around and shout about it. But we don't do nothing more. Drafted for police action. But they decided on a war. Telling us we were saving mankind. Why don't you ask Cambodia. We were solving it with marijuana. We were sure that we could. Always leavin' it to someone else. Just knocking on wood. We're goin' back to the trenches. We're goin' back to the trenches. Well you say you got a say so. But you're knowin' that it ain't so. And you turn away. You think it's safer to ignore it. But the score is your children have to pay. Everybody wants better. Everybody talkin' 'bout it. Are we wastin' time. Gotta stop only lookin' talkin'. We're all guilty of the crime. We're goin' back to the trenches. We're goin' back to the trenches. We gotta move we got everything to lose. We gotta move we got everything to lose. We're all headed for the front. But everybody's fightin' for a good address. It's time we made the changes. Or we'll be burnin' with the rest. We just ain't communicatin' and I don't. Mean conversations on the telephone. When Nero starts to fiddle this time. There's a lot more gonna burn than Rome. we're goin' back to the trenches. we're goin' back to the trenches. we're goin' back to the trenches. we're goin' back to the trenches. .

Making pig iron pig iron pig iron. Making pig iron pig iron pig iron. Drive the steel bar into the taphole. Pour the metal down into the sows. Blasted one side frozen the other side. Rain and snow and sleet and blow. Taller than the church's steeple. Forever the big chimney owns my soul. I'm midwife to a pig of iron. Born of flame and sweat and coal. Pig iron pig iron pig iron.

I'd be with you tonight. Oh Oh. I put my headphones and went right to the Beatlrs. Looked out the window saw your face amongst the stars. Didn't ask in London and I wonder if you'd been here. And if you know you caught my heart. From the first time I saw you at the coffee shop on Melrose. With your skinny black jeans and your long blonde hair.

And our hearts were high. When the day was young. And the night was long. And the moon stood still. For the night bird song. If you go away if you go away if you go away. But if you stay. I'll make you a day. Like no day has ever been. Or will be again. We'll sail on the sun. We'll ride on the rain. We'll talk to the trees. And worship the wind. And if you go. I'll understand. Leave me just enough love. To hold in my hand. If you go away if you go away if you go away. If you go away. As I know you will. You must tell the world to stop turning. Till you return to me. If you ever do. Oh what good is love without loving you?. I can tell you now as you turn to go. I'll be dying slowly. Till your next hello. If you go away if you go away if you go away. But if you stay. I'll make you a night. Like no night has ever been. Or will be again. I'll sail on you smile. I'll ride on your touch. I'll talk to your eyes. That I love so much. But if you go. I'll understand. Leave me just enough love. To hold in my hand. If you go away if you go away if you go away if you go away. If you go away as I know you must.

If you might have kept me by your side. If you go away if you go away if you go away..

So I`m out and on my way. Teardrops from the sky a trashcan full of harmonies. Time to say good bye all the luck in this world. Don`t you ask me why I got to face reality. No way no more lies so I`m out and on my way. When I breakdown on my knees with suicidal tendencies. You are always on my mind nothing lives eternally.

You are always on my mind nothing lives eternally. Scenes run through my head never forget the shattered dream. I got to do what I got to do please forgive. Chorus (4x)

3857,"sung by Jim. written by William. Too long I have been a slave. Kissing dirt for what I crave. Too long I have been a liar. Too long I had fun with fire. Ghosts of people I have been. Come around and shout ""obscene"". Ghosts of things I've said and done. Come to haunt me watch me run. Everybody I know is falling apart. Everybody I know wants to die. Wants to find."
3858,Who’ll face the tide. And take their chances. Will fasten the lights. To broken branches. Adrift on the ocean. In wild winter storms. I have to imagine things. To keep myself warm. The night closing in. But not to worry. Told everyone I know. That I was sorry. But I heard them all singing. For comfort and peace. And in my confusion here. I still believe. You were the one to make me cry. You were the one to take me home. Of all the people in my life. My thoughts keep returning to you. But consciousness is fading fast. Surrounded by sights. That go on living. Make circles in time. The spider web spinning. Well I have no illusions. Of where I am now. I’ll let this wave take me. And pour me down. You were the one to make me cry. You were the one to take me home. Of all the stories in my life. Only good things return to you. If I could only say the words. If you could hear me cry for help. But I’d lift my head up to the sky. And the planes that were circling. Now have gone

3863,"""I'm the one who can please you"". Ain't that what you said. You seemed so alone. I guess I was easily led. I showed you my love. But I guess that it went to your head. When you were hungry. I brought you your breakfast in bed. Even it up even it up even it up. Even it up even it up even it up. A good man pays his debt. But you ain't paid yours yet. Even it. Even it up. I took you down over the tracks when. you wanted some sin. I brought you satin and herbs from. the places I been. Now something tells me you're. going to use me again.

Got the city on the lock down. Drive by in the slow ride. Hands high when we fly by. System up with the top down. Got the city on the lock down. Drive by in the slow ride. Hands high when we fly by.

3882,"Man walks along the railroad track. He's Goin' some place there's no turnin' back. The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up over the ridge. Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge. The shelter line stretchin' around the corner. Welcome to the New World Order. Families sleepin' in their cars out in the Southwest. No job no home no peace no rest NO REST!. And The highway is alive tonight. Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes. I'm sitting down here in the campfire light. Searchin' for the Ghost of Tom Joad. He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag. The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag. He's waitin' for the time when the last shall be first and the first shall be last. In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass. With a one way ticket to the promised land. With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand. Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock. Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts. And The highway is alive tonight. Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes. I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light. With the Ghost of old Tom Joad. Guitar Solo. Now Tom Said; ""Ma whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy. Wherever a hungry new born baby cries. Whereever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air. Look for me ma'. I'll be there. Wherever somebodies stuglin' for a place to stand. For a decent job or a helpin' hand. Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free. Look in their eyes ma. You'll see me! (repeat 8 times). And the highway is alive tonight. nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes. I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light. With the Ghost of Tom Joad.."

3886,It was suspicious days. I lost sight of an enemy. I did not notice the pit [I am foolish?]. Put and end to stillness. I can't yet die. [I can't miss the eyes from fate]. This bullet is all openings. Don't forget the meaning that pulled a trigger. I bet all on this bullet. Don't forget the meaning that pulled a trigger. Hesitating means death.

3887,Although he had a past history. The mischief has soon passed. A spunky little kid from North West Five. Longed for the mystery to last. Free as the wind. Wild as a march hare. With oh so much to learn. Careful that you don't get burned. The boy who wouldn't grow up. Chasing his own tail. The boy who couldn't grow up. An outing on bail. Oh idiot child. Clutching to life. Always made to grow up. Always told to shut up. Idiot child. Clutching to life. Always destined to fail. Always ending up in jail. Lo and behold the gherkin men with their military stance did shout. Mark my words Mrs Hutchinson. We'll sort this laddie out. The parent teachers association secretly fixed a date. A giant swoop is authorised to sign and seal his fate. Oh sent away for a year and a day. He was taken so orderly. And drilled into his delicate shell. To behave normally. Oh idiot child. Clutching to life. (Clutching to life). The boy who never grew up. Always told to shut up. Idiot child. Clutching onto life. (Clutching to life). Always destined to fail. Always ending up in jail. Some things are so predictable ain't they. Some things just never change look around. Most animals are trained at an early age. But some of us just never lay down. Idiot child. Just clutching to life. The boy who never grew up. Always made to shut up. Idiot child. Clutching to life. (Clutching to life). Always destined to fail. Always ending up in jail. Idiot child. Clutching to life. (Clutching to life). The boy who never grew up. Always told to shut up. Idiot child. Clutching onto life. (Clutching to life). Always destined to fail. Always ending up in jail. Always destined to fail. Always winding up in jail. Always ending up in jail. Always destined to fail

N' I know they would steal your heart. To see my love tortured. Render trust a hostage to fortune. Rumors seduce like fire. Seducing illusions driving the chariot. Of hearts astray. Standing silent vigil over the moments. Of ease that still remain. With a thorn to the side for every good deed. N' I know they would steal your heart. Every day is a day we awake into this life. Another chance another line to define. And we will dance we will play. And experience a lifetime. Every day is a day we die. Cos I know they would steal your heart. N' I know they would steal. Your heart to see my love tortured. Render trust a hostage to fortune. Rumors seduce like wildfire. Steal your heart to see my love tortured

And then you can't loose control Say your time has come and then. Hard to pinpoint find the seam Where that one time ends. Where that time begins Remember you decide. Take that vow Take a stand. Grab that ring It's not a whim. It's not a whim It's only time. That you're cashing in. In the white noise of desire. We can't hear a single thing. Floating round the fragile bough Afflictions of the human soul. Its beauty immaterial. You decide Stand along. The fallen ones Take revenge. Defeated sons Rend that coat. From seam to seam It's only time. It's only time That you spend. You spend It's only time. You spend Its only time. You spend It's only life. That you're cashing in

3955,Somber sister. This is a strange and bitter fruit. Because you taught me to sing. And the rhythm in my heart. And the rhythm in my feet is -. Why are the rainbows. Stolen from the sky. And locked up in boxes. Yellow black red and white. Like birds in their cages. Beating their wings on the bars. And there's a song that they're singing. It's a word in the world. It's a word in their hearts. A part hate. I heard a man say. Tear apart hate. And I saw hope in his face. A part hate. Where the color of love. Slips away. Why are the children. Carrying guns not books. Drug dealing not learning. The golden rule. And the idea of freedom. Not just the same. Castle in the sky. Haunted by white-sheeted ghouls. Filled with hate me. And hate you. And proud of it too. A part hate. Heard a woman saying. Tear apart hate. And I saw hope in her face. A part hate. Where the color of love. Slips away. Why are the people. Running down the block. Rock throwing not knowing. What else to do. But I'm just a spectator. And I can never know the pain. But when I hear. That whip cracking. I cry out tears of anger. I cry out tears of shame. A part hate. I heard myself say. Tear apart hate. And I saw hope in my face. A part hate. Where the color of love. Slips away.... Tear apart hate tear apart hate. Tear apart hate tear apart hate. Tear apart hate tear apart hate....

3964,This is the springtime of my loving - the second season I am to know. You are the sunlight in my growing - so little warmth I've felt before.. It isn't hard to feel me glowing - I watched the fire that grew so low.. It is the summer of my smiles - flee from me Keepers of the Gloom.. Speak to me only with your eyes. It is to you I give this tune.. Ain't so hard to recognize - These things are clear to all from. time to time.. Talk Talk - I've felt the coldness of my winter. I never thought it would ever go. I cursed the gloom that set upon us.... But I know that I love you so. These are the seasons of emotion and like the winds they rise and fall. This is the wonder of devotion - I see the torch we all must hold.. This is the mystery of the quotient - Upon us all a little rain must fall.

3967,And the clots they never stop. They barricade my veins. And the clots keep building up. They suffocate my brain. I built them to destroy myself. They're circling the prey. I push until I break. I feel them start to scrape. The core of all I am is chiseling away. And every spec of life is gonna rot away in time. We turn to mud or turn to stone it's the grand design. A maze of petrified hearts and I'm lost inside. We all self-destruct to love is to deny. And that is life. And the clots they never stop. They tear beneath my skin. And the clots keep building up. They rip new holes again. You're here to turn me inside out. And then turn me away. For all my life I'd choke. On clouds of savior's smoke. Until my blackened soul was burning away. And every spec of life is gonna rot away in time. We turn to mud or turn to stone it's the grand design. A maze of petrified hearts and I'm lost inside. We all self-destruct to love is to deny. And that is life. We build our castles and we stomp them back to dust. Like ants we climb the hill again. Tell me how many times. Am I supposed to die. Before you lift the cross and let a man rise. And every spec of life is gonna rot away in time. We turn to mud or turn to stone it's the grand design. A maze of petrified hearts and I'm lost inside. We all self-destruct to love is to deny. And that is life. We are the clots

And there's a thousand faces of me. And we're gonna rise up. And we're gonna rise up. For every time you broke me. Well you're gonna face an army. Army of me. Welcome to my revolution.

He’s insane. Calling on the day. ��til the clouds get blown away. While inside his mind. Lie all of space and time. And the farthest ones unite. It’s a saturday sun. And the madness is won. And the night has been sung. Out of existence. And my head is alright. Was the darkest of nights. Now the cadmium sun. Is calling on the day. Til the clouds get blown away. There’s an eye inside his mind. For all of space and time. He’s been waiting for a sign. Looking for the revelation maybe. Or visions of the underworld. But when you saw the first light. Then you know it’s alright. It’s a saturday sun. And the madness is won. And the nightmare is done. In time he wakes. Colours up the sky. Make the darkness come to life. Memories inside his heart. Of everything he wants to know. And every place he has to go

Reveal myself to you. I lost a wing and grew a shell on the wound. Oh so soon. And heartbreak no you can’t catch me. Hot on my heals but I move too fast. I know you think that I would make good company…at last. You always come ’round after your good friend love. Has gone and run aground. A heart in shambles oh it’s just what you need. Your purpose found. And heartbreak no you can’t catch me. Hot on my heals but I move too fast. I know you think that I would make good company…yours at last. I’m free to wander so get up off of your knees. And find some other fool. Someone who’ll hold you when you’ve got no one to tease. It won’t be me

They never will leave. The rain and the storms. The snow and the winds. That guide you depart.. They took you far away. Right out of my life.. They condemned us and. They'd stolen my heart.. They never will leave you. My hopes or my memories.. I've lost all my loving. Got nowhere to turn.. My happiness with you. Has drowned in my tears. The tears that will fall until. The day you return.. The tears that will fall until. The day you return.. The tears that will fall until.

3992,A freedom that a few of us can claim. The moment when there's no one to blame. The breaking point. with all the things you knew. I cast away my pride and disappear.

Despite what you say. The search for what I'm really made of. To own the keys to live the way I want. And put myself together and be as one. There's certainly more out there you can see. You'll be left to wonder if you sleep. It's not a hoax you'll see when all has been done. I'm headed to the road of the unknown. I may look like a fool. To you it sounds like an odd decision.

The tears in your eyes oh that girl's tryin' to say. Oh little girl you know I could love you. But first I must make my getaway. Two strange men fightin' to the death over me today.

4004,Don't bother going through your motions. Nothing that makes sense ever works out. Don't kid yourself you know they want money. Nothing can be good on its own merit. Spinning and spinning.

Don't kid yourself you know it's for money. Please keep in sight what makes you care. You have it always.... Spinning and spinning. Do you believe in what you want?. Dancing in plastic shake-up snow. Do you believe in what you want?. Your camera flash. On us meaningless. You cannot waste a single night. What you ignore is priceless to me

4011,Laying lost and wounded. Just myself to blame. Have no life and. Being hand-fed pain. Head's a crying wasteland. Filled with shame. Cried for help before and. Nobody came. His father beats him. No hesitation. His face left dripping. In humiliation. As he lies wounded. His father turns to clay. A frozen statue. Can't walk away. His head's a crying wasteland. Filled with shame. Cried for help before and. Nobody came. To see what I can lose again. For being the victim. No.
4012,Did you see that I was hurt. Did you know that you had left me crying there. Now I’m holding all your words close till you feel this pain too yeah. You live on so unaware. While I thought somehow this hate would heal me. But this hate is never ending and it’s only killing me. Oh sweet revenge you’ve lied again. I find I can’t get free till I release this vengeance that I seek. Forgive you the only thing I want to live I’m ready to be free to be free. Maybe you’ve been wounded too. Maybe all this is your self-protection. And all the hurts you thought were hidden. Are the ones now hurting me. So who will make this pattern end. I find I can’t get free till I release this vengeance that I seek. Forgive you the only thing I want to live I’m ready to…. Break these chains. Won’t see this through. ‘Cause setting you free. It means my freedom too. Freedom too. I find I can’t get free till I release this vengeance that I seek. Forgive you the only thing I want to live I’m ready to be free to be free
4013,When will the morning come ?. I wait in darkness so long.. Will the sun ever rise again ?. Hours flowing over me. I wait in vain for some change.. Will light ever pierce this pain ?. Riding on a humming bird's wing. Caravans fleeing from the East.. May the pilgrim join in the feast.. How will the morning be ?. I watched the dawn in my dreams. And imagined the day for years.. Shall I feel warmth again. And feel it true when they say. That the day never ends in tears ?. Riding on a humming bird's wing. Caravans fleeing from the East.. May the pilgrim join in the feast.. Tell me please. How will it come. This release. A crack in the door.. Shall I feel warm again. And feel it true when they say. That the day never ends in tears ?. Beyond and back of the wind. Little birds fly into the sea.. Morning light shine on me.. Oh tell me please how will she come. Surrounding me the opening door ?. Riding on a humming bird's wing. Caravans fleeing from the East.. May the pilgrim join in the feast. Beyond and back of the wind. Little birds fly into the sea.. Morning light shine on me.. Riding on a humming bird's wing.

Oh why can?t you just say no. Get your keys phone fags and cash to blow. Think you?ll wear that little dress from Topshop. Put it on and run to the bus-stop. It shouldn?t take you more than a minute.

4024,Doctor:. He seems to be completely unreceptive.. The tests I gave him show no sense at all.. His eyes react to light the dials detect it.. He hears but cannot answer to your call.. Tommy:. See me feel me touch me heal me.. See me feel me touch me heal me.. Doctor:. There is no chance no untried operation.. All hope lies with him and none with me.. Imagine though the shock from isolation.. When he suddenly can hear and speak and see.. Tommy:. See me feel me touch me heal me.. See me feel me touch me heal me.. Doctor:. His eyes can see. his ears can hear his lips speak. All the time the needles flick and rock.. No machine can give the kind of stimulation. Needed to remove his inner block.. Go to the mirror boy!. Go to the mirror boy!. Father:. I often wonder what he's feeling.. Has he ever heard a word I've said?. Look at him now in the mirror dreaming. What is happening in his head?. Tommy:. Listening to you I get the music.. Gazing at you I get the heat. Following you I climb the mountain. I get excitement at your feet!. Right behind you I see the millions. On you I see the glory.. From you I get the opinions. From you I get the story.. Father:. What is happening in his head. Ooooh I wish I knew I wish I knew..
4025,Birds and butterflies. Rivers and mountains she creates. But you'll never know. The next move she'll make. You can try. But it is useless to ask why. Cannot control her. She goes her own way. She rules until the end of time. She gives and she takes. She rules until the end of time. She goes her way. With every breath. And all the choices that we make. We are only passing through on her way. I find my strength. Believing that your soul lives on. Until the end of time. I'll carry it with me. Until you know my dear. You don't have to fear. A new beggining always starts at the end. Until you know my dear. You don't have to fear. Until the end of time. Until the end of time. Until the end of time. She goes her way
4026,"When I was a young man I carried my pack. And I lived the free life of a rover. From the Murrays green basin to the dusty outback. I waltzed my Matilda all over. Then in nineteen fifteen my country said Son. It's time to stop rambling 'cause there's work to be. done. So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun. And they sent me away to the war. And the band played Waltzing Matilda. As we sailed away from the quay. And amidst all the tears and the shouts and the. cheers. We sailed off to Gallipoli. How well I remember that terrible day. <When> the blood stained the sand and the water. And how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay. We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter. Johnny Turk he was ready he primed himself well. He <showered> us with bullets he rained us with. shells. And in five minutes flat he'd blown us all to hell. Nearly blew us right back to Australia. But the band played Waltzing Matilda. As we stopped to bury our slain. And we buried ours and the Turks buried theirs. Then <it> started all over again. Now those <who were living did their best to survive>. In <that> mad world of blood death and fire. And for <seven long> weeks I kept myself alive. <While the corpses around me piled higher>. Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over tit. And when I woke up in my hospital bed. And saw what it had done <Christ> I wished I was. dead. Never knew there were worse things than dying. <And> no more I'll go waltzing Matilda. <To> the green <bushes so> far and near. For to hump tent and pegs a man needs two legs. No more waltzing Matilda for me. So they collected the cripples the wounded <and>. maimed. And they shipped us back home to Australia. <The legless the armless> the blind <and> insane. Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla. And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay. I looked at the place where <me> legs used to be. And thank Christ there was nobody waiting for me. To grieve and to mourn and to pity. And the band played Waltzing Matilda. As they carried us down the gangway. But nobody cheered they just stood and stared. <And they> turned all their faces away. And now every April I sit on my porch. And I watch the parade pass before me. <I see> my old comrades how proudly they march. Reliving <the or their> dreams of past glory. <I see the old men all twisted and torn>. The forgotten heroes <of> a forgotten war. And the young people ask <me> ""What are they. marching for?"". And I ask myself the same question. And the band plays Waltzing Matilda. And the old men <still> answer to the call. But year after year their numbers get fewer. Some day no one will march there at all. Waltzing Matilda Waltzing Matilda. Who'll <go> a-waltzing Matilda with me?."
4028,Who who. Who who. Who who. Who who. You ask for someone I can dignify. A guiding force in which I thought I could rely. I watch as you begin to metamorphisize.

Who-o-o. Who-o-o. Who-o-o. Who the fuck are you. You were someone in whom I could convide. You pushed me further away with every single lie. You used to have a soul and then it surely died. What happened when you turned to the other side. Not even I recognise. For every words a lie. You are forever changed and. There is nothing more left I can do. Who-o-o. Who-o-o. Who-o-o. Fall down on you. Who-o-o. Who-o-o. Who-o-o. Who the fuck are you. Who!. You and I. Where were once so. You and I. Hes was once incredable. You and I. We were once so. You and I. We were indavisable.

4029,I could talk for hours but you wouldn't hear a word. Your own opinions make you blind. There will come a morning when the sand has all run out. There will be no time to change your mind. Like a thief in the night He will come. There will be nowhere left you can run to. You can fall with the night or you can rise. With the son. He will come in glory a rider in the sky. The lion and the lamb rest side by side. Children of the kingdom He will gather to himself. Children of the darkness He will leave behind. Like a thief in the night He will come. There will be nowhere left you can run to. You can fall with the night or you can rise. With the son.
4030,I pay my dues all for truth. Can't leave it here and leave it here. and leave it here forgotten. Silence rules spineless fools. You'll never learn never learn never learn to break away. Oh why can't we rise again?. When all the days go by the firelight. We'll never fade out in the night. And we are restrained but drawn to the flame. We are the fire to the rain. Isn't it strange that love is in the way?. It never goes away never goes away. I paid my dues all for truce. I leave it here leave it here leave it here forgotten. Life it rules over truth. We'll never learn never learn never learn to break away. Oh why can't we rise again?. When all the days go by the firelight. We'll never fade out in the night. And we are restrained but drawn to the flame. We are the fire to the rain. Isn't it strange that love is in the way?. Isn't it strange that love is in the way?. When all the days go by the firelight. We'll never fade out in the night. And we are restrained but drawn to the flame. We are the fire to the rain. Isn't strange that love is in the way. It never goes away away
4032,She don't want to be here. She lost your sound sleeping high. Trying to find her way back here. Count count all you want. They're not really sheep. It's the shit that you did. It's why you can't sleep. It's why you never will. She gets high and says that she's the queen of the whole world. Just look at her shine. She's coming around. Got money in the bank. Got no one to trust it's all gone. And there. She walks that lonely street. Idling fine. Forget this is not taught it's just understood. Who paid the phone bill?. Who fuckin' cares?. She lets on. She's the queen of everything now. To see you walking by. She's so fine. Everything is so sweet. Everything moves the way it should. And everything’s gone now the time. So welcome to it babe. Welcome to the night. Welcome to it babe. Welcome for a while. Loving pictures in the aftermath. Feels easy now no wind to bring back all the hell up on the street. Things you might forget you go counting sheep or counting silhouettes. You feel clean. Washing it off with memories. That just don't mean a fuck. You wish you were like the rest of us. So stupid in taking our time. So stupid in taking our time. It's dead night
4033,Well in eighteen and fourteen we took a little trip. along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip.. We took a little bacon and we took a little beans. And we caught the bloody British near the town of New Orleans.. We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin.. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.. We fired once more and they began to runnin'. down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.. Well we looked down the river and we see'd the British come. and there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum.. They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring. while we stood by our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.. We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin.. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.. We fired once more and they began to runnin'. down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.. Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise. if we didn't fire a musket til we looked 'em in the eyes.. We held our fire til we see'd their faces well. then we opened up with squirrel guns and really gave a yell.. We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin..

4101,Separated I cut myself clean. From a past that comes back in my darkest of dreams. Been apprehended by a spiritual force. And a grace that replaced all the me I've divorced. I saw a man with tat on his big fat belly. It wiggled around like marmalade jelly. It took me a while to catch what it said. Cause I had to match the rhythm of his belly with my head. 'Jesus Saves' is what it raved in a typical tattoo green. He stood on a box in the middle of the city. And claimed he had a dream. What will people think. When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak. What will people do when they find that it's true. I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak. There ain't no disguising the truth. [There ain't no disgusing the truth]. [I don't need to hide it... The truth]. Kamikaze my death is gain. I've been marked by my Maker. A peculiar display. The high and lofty they see me as weak. Cause I won't live and die for the power they seek. There was a man from the desert with naps in his head. The sand that he walked was also his bed. The words that he spoke made the people assume. There wasn't too much left in the upper room. With skins on his back and hair on his face. They thought he was strange by the locusts he ate. The Pharisees tripped when they heard him speak. Until the king took the head of this Jesus freak. What will people think. When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak. What will people do when they find that it's true. I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak. There ain't no disguising the truth. People say I'm strange does it make me a stranger. That my best friend was born in a manger. People say I'm strange does it make me a stranger. That my best friend was born in a manger. What will people think. When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak. What will people do when they find that it's true. I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak. There ain't no disguising the truth. What will people think. When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak. What will people do when they find that it's true. I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak. There ain't no disguising the truth. What will people think [What will people think]. What will people do [What will people do]. I don't really care [What else can I say]. There ain't no disguising the truth [Jesus is the way]

4110,Well he can't sleep at night. And he can't do what's right. It was all because she came into his life. It's a deep obsession taking up his time. Chorus:. She's all that he wants she's all that he needs. She's everything he just won't believe. Take away his doubt turn him inside out. Then she can see what he's been dying to say. But things don't always turn out that way. And he must confess. All the impure thoughts of his beautiful temptress. Although he keeps it all bottled up inside. Although he keeps it all safe within his mind oh yeah. Chorus. So wipe that smile off your face. Before it gets too late. There's only so much time. For you to make up your mind. Chorus.
4111,I've never had much cause for worry. And I've not got a lot to say. You'll never find me in a hurry. Because I live my life day by day. People say that I'm crazy. But I'm not that way inclined. I know what I know and I'll happily show. That madness is all in the mind. Twenty-four hours is all that I care for. I believe that's the only way. Twenty-four hours is all that is needed. Because I live my life day by day. People say that I'm crazy. But I'm not that way inclined. I know what I know and I'll happily show. That madness is all in the mind. I'm happy the way that I do things. Continually feeling okay. I've no worries on what tomorrow brings. Because I live my life day by day. People say that I'm crazy. But I'm not that way inclined. I know what I know and I'll happily show. That madness is all in the mind. Well some men seek answers in bottles. And others in degenerate ways. But I don't care much for the question. Madness is all in the mind. Madness is all in the mind. Madness is all in the mind. Madness is all in the mind.

4116,Jefferson was always out of luck. I remember when we both grew up. Jefferson got hit by a westbound truck. I guess that didn't make him look like a million bucks.

And everybody learned your game 'round here but that's alright. You told me if i stayed 'round here you'd find a good enough place to hide. But i see you. I see you. So come on out tonight.

And i told you if you stay down here you might wind up by my side. And that's true. That's true. So come on out tonight. And all my friends told me “you don't need laws to tell. That if it feels like fallin' boy you probably already fell. The whole table saw your hand so you might as well just play it. And you ain't fooling anyone so you might as well just say it…”. So i guess i'm in love. I guess i'm in love. Some people get scared of those words 'round here but that's alright. Some people pretend they ain't heard ‘em 'round here but that's alright.

4132,From his army confessions of his military days. You still carry the shrapnel you're shell-shocked and dazed. Dear Johnny have you lost your way. Or like denim and leather are you faded and frayed. Institute lackies with hot bourbon breath. White coats and needles Johnny like to scare you to death. Dear Johnny do you feel your best. When you're strung out at night on your morphine and meth. Jackknife Johnny you're a floor moppin' flunkie. Tool of a dagger's drawn world. Jackknife Johnny them old vets gotta hate you. For bringing home that V.C. girl. Jackknife Johnny welcome to our world. From the tone deaf hearing of the draft board game. You were washing cars down in Dallas when the holocaust came. Dear Johnny your excuse was lame. All your friends sleep in boxes while you sleep in chains. Jackknife Johnny you're a bad jungle monkey. Tool of a dagger's drawn world. Jackknife Johnny them old vets gotta hate you. For bringing home that V.C. girl. Jackknife Johnny welcome to our world. Jackknife Johnny you're a floor moppin' flunkie.

I never wanted to be this me. (Erase eraser). Show me back then. The kid before the man. I don't think this me is who I am. Oh middle age. Come bring me a crisis. What am I worth?.

4134,(Allen Collins -- Ronnie VanZant). You got to love ol' Charlie Daniels. You got to cut the rug with Wet Willie too. And you got to be a fan of the Marshall Tucker Band. Before I'll sit down and have a drink with you. Yes Bakersfield has got ol' Merle Haggard. He's a bad bad boy yes indeed. Nashville's got a million and one guitar pickers. But I guess my favorite would be the CDB. (Chorus). Yes there's a few good rockers in New York City. Guess the big LA it never cared for me. So won't you tell all them Hollywierd writer people. That it just don't make a damn. When you got good friends like me. Never pick on good ol' Waylon Jennings. Or Willie Nelson Bob Wills or me. Well they're playin' that good ol' country-western. You know this thing they call the Texas Swing. (Chorus).
4136,Uh uh uh... Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh.... Can you see it's full of lightning. All the futures that I see are whitening.. I see the time of yesterday. Become the time that we have today oh!. I'm looking for a hidden meaning. Can you tell me if it's just a feeling?. I see the light shining in your eyes. Is it love just in disguise?. I saw the light shine out today. I saw the light shine out today.. And it told me that that you're not the one for me. That you're not the one for me.. Can you hear the ancient calling?. I see the empires we built are falling.. All we have is a human touch ah. Think I can stick it even as we rush ah!
4137,Close the door on a short night. Lift the lid on the daylight. 6: 09 West Tennessee time. And I buy all my days. At the same place where the girl sells her nights. To a God of ocean tides. All night long. Writing poems to California. Melodies of failure. And the people I have thrown away. Meanwhile somewhere west of Carolina. In a congregation of strangers. We are digging holes to China. Then we pray to our reflections. In the water when it rises. I said headlights pin the highway down. Jesus spins the world around. And I'll spend all my tomorrows coming down. Goodbye all my days. I know I said I never loved you. But I might just try again tonight. Truck stops and river Gods. Gas stations of the Cross. Following a ghost. Following a ghost. I pray the water wash away. The memories and the cost. Cary me south to the sea. Along with your memories of me. We are born in the water. Now we return to Thee. Colored lights. And birthday cakes. Candle wax. On paper plates. Breathe the water. Hush-a-bye hush-a-bye. You can see through water. All the way up to the sky. Gods of water Gods of rain. Cover up the sun again. We are crossing it at the Mississippi line. And I tried all my days. To love you just the way you hoped I might. But I'm leaving here tonight. I can't remember yesterday. I tried if I said I could I lied
4138,They paved paradise and put up a parkin' lot. With a pink hotel a boutique and a swingin' hot spot. Don't it always seem to go. That you don't know what you got till it's gone. They paved paradise and put up a parking lot. They took all the trees and put em in a tree museum. And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them. Don't it always seem to go. That you don't know what you got till it's gone. They paved paradise and put up a parking lot. Hey farmer farmer put away your DDT. I don't care about spots on my apples. LEAVE me the birds and the bees please. Don't it always seem to go. That you don't know what you got till it's gone. They paved paradise and put up a parking lot. Hey now they paved paradise to put up a parking lot. Why not?. Listen late last night heard the screen door slam. And a big yellow taxi took my girl away. Don't it always seem to go. That you don't know what you got till it's gone. They paved paradise and put up a parking lot. Well don't it always seem to go. That you don't know what you got till it's gone. They paved paradise to put up a parking lot. Well now they paved paradise. And put up a parking lot. I don't wanna give it. Why you wanna give it. Why you wanna givin it all away. Hey hey hey. Now you wanna give it. I should wanna give it. Now you wanna givin it all away. Hey paved paradise put up a parking lot. Paved paradise and put up a parking lot
4139,Fill the sky with love. Fill the sky with love. I wouldn't mind but she just turned up on the doorstep. Wishful in ashes slightly bedraggled. Last time I saw her she was howling at the moon. Roaming the forest leap pine and rabbits. Oh is she wild?. Does she see my inner child?. But then she knows it's like a curse. To find the chosen roles reversed. To unify my universe. To call me mellow. If only I was half-mage and she was older. We'd live on ice-cream on Coney Island. I know it's gravity that drags down my balloon. She stays in orbit way after midnight. Oh slip and slide. Does she go on the Elide?. But then she knows it's like a curse. To find the chosen roles reversed. To unify my universe. To call me mellow. She'll dress down for us. She'll break new grounds for us. Watching me cracking up. She'll hang around fellows. With all the groundswellers. Driving me like a truck. But then she knows it's like a curse. To find the chosen roles reversed. To unify my universe. To call me mellow
4140,(Well) I'm goin' left. 'Til you lead me to the right. Lead me to what is right. I'm goin' left. 'Til you lead me to the right. Lead me to what is right. There's a train people say. I could ride to get my whole life straight. But the bridge on the way. Has a toll too much for me to pay. Yes I know it must be. What I chose could mean my destiny. Lights are green all is go. But my heart keeps telling my mind no. (Well) I'm goin' left. 'Til you lead me to the right. Lead me to what is right. I'm goin' left. 'Til you lead me to the right. Lead me to what is right. There's a land over there. Where all are given equal share. What you get is so small. It's like never having nothing at all. Take my hand as a friend. A will stick with you until the end. But I'm in doubt I must decline. 'Cause even friends can change their lines. (Well) I'm goin' left. 'Til you lead me to the right. Lead me to what is right. I'm goin' left. 'Til you lead me to the right. Lead me to what is right
4141,[Verse 1: Cassie]. It's not about me I do this for you. Still wanna talk shit about everything I do. Crazy thing about it ? I'm gettin' high. Way out in space while you wait down in the sky. Crazy thing about it ? I'm gettin' paid. If you do what I say ? attitude might change. Crazy thing about it ? I'm doin' me. While we do each other it's like a movie scene. Crazy thing about it ? everything been crazy. So I look at you in my mirror and say ?take care of me baby?. [Hook]. Take care of me baby. Take care of me baby. Take care of me baby. Take care of me baby. Take care of me baby. Take care of me baby. Take care of me baby. Take care of me baby. [Verse 1: Pusha T]. Take care of you ? I don't care if I'm buying.

All I'm missing is a jack-o-lantern. Trick or treating's in season. All your jewels is now freezin'. All your pumps is now teasin'. Every heel is like 6-inch. All your jeans is now squeezin'. When you in it for the long haul. You crawl with her you ball with her. She shotgun. And my milk Ghost so damn ripe I'mma spoil with her. Like Jodeci she forever my lady. On a talk show I'll tell Maury I'mma take care of that baby. Ah! Push!. [Verse 2: Cassie]. Baby? even if we lost everything I'd be right there. It's crazy?. when you know you've got everything sitting right there. Crazy thing about it ? they the ones confused. Payin' us all this attention when I know they could use.

Take care of me baby. Take care of me baby. Take care of me baby. Take care of me baby. Take care of me baby
4142,Well I feel so sorry for you. You'll always be the same. 'cos you're sad you're sad. And I think you're very selfish. And you play a vicious game. 'cos you're bad you're bad. And you'll end up very lonely. And you may end up in pain. 'cos you're mad you're mad. I think you're awful. I think you're horrible. A waste of space (x2). It's your bad behavior. But you never see. Such a shame such a shame. You'll always be the same. I'm sickened for the mother. Who endured your pain. Such a shame such a shame. You'll always be the same. I'm sickened for the mother. Who endured your pain. Arrogance ignorance (x3). Ooooo. I should think you're very selfish. I should think you're very sad. It's your bad behavior. I should think you're very thankless. For the things you never had. It's your bad behavior. Repeat Chorus
4143,How do you get your sleep at night. How did you get your noose so tight.. Like chewing on tin foil it's so much fun. Gonna be dead before your gone.. Your telling names that've got it. And I'll be happy 'till I won't be dead.. And I'll pretend that your going down. And I'll be laughing I'll be laughing.. How many feelings can you steal. Gonna be part of your appeal.. I can see through you 'cause your wearing thin. Like chewing on tin foil once again.. Your telling names that've got it. And I'll be happy 'till I won't be dead.. And I'll pretend that your going down. And I'll be laughing.. Ha ha your're dead. And I'm so happy.. In loving memory. Of your demise.. When your ship is going down. I'll go out and break the town.. Ha ha you're dead. Ha ha you're dead. Ha ha you're dead.. Ha ha ha. Ha ha you're dead. And I'm so happy.. In loving memory. Of your demise.. When your ship is going down. I'll go out and break the town.. Ha ha you're dead. Ha ha you're dead. Ha ha you're dead.. Ha ha you're dead. The joke is over.. You were an asshole. And now your gone.. As your ship is going down. I'll stand by and watch you drown.. Ha ha you're dead. Ha ha you're dead. Ha ha you're dead.. Ha ha you're dead your gonna be dead.. Just remember what I said.. Ha ha you're dead. Ha ha you're dead. Ha ha you're dead.
4144,So you're tired but you're alive. So open up your eyes. And you can get your sleep when you are dead. Kill the clock inside your head. Bring your normalcy to the edge. And watch it drown in new horizons. New horizons. You said I'd only have to wait until I die but that's in no time. How did we come to think and this was funny. Cheering and laughing at the dying. While we're riding the light in you. Wait you said I'd only have to wait. Until I die (new horizons). There is no such thing as time. Inside this moment no sun rising. Wait until I fly (new horizons). Wait until I fly (new horizons). Sin with a conquest lifeless. Sin with a new quest. Here's a voice for the voiceless. And a song for the soulless. Lifeless sin. Wait you said I'd only have to wait until I die (new horizons). There is no such thing as time. Inside this moment no sun rising. Wait until I fly (new horizons). Wait until I fly (new horizons). When the times keep going wrong and we go right. When the times keep going wrong and we go right. Wait you said I'd only have to wait until I die (new horizons). There is no such thing as time. Inside this moment no sun rising. Wait until I fly (new horizons). Wait until I fly (new horizons). When the time keeps going wrong and we go right. We go right
4145,There's a face in the window. Lookin' back at me. There's a face in the window. I just can't see.. That face in the window. Keeps haunting me.. I went walking after midnight. Up and down the street. I went walking after midnight. Up and down the street. When I stopped for a smoke. I heard shuffling feet.. Well I stopped for a smoke. What did I see?. A face in the filter. Lookin' back at me.. Ah listen to me baby. Hear what I have to say.. Yeah listen to me baby. Hear what I have to say.. These midnight blues. They won't go away. These midnight blues. Won't go away.. Yeah I stopped for a smoke. What did I see?. A face in the filter. Lookin' back at me.. I'm walking after midnight.
4147,(Anderson/Squire). Looking around me. There's not so much in life I miss.. Things that I can't see. I'll touch and I'll feel then I'll kiss.. Then I saw you standing there. With a smile I couldn't share. Just looking around ev'rywhere.. All the things I've wanted to do. Take so much time to get around to you.. Just reach out and catch and hold on. Leaving trails of dust and lust. Never even ly'ng or try'ng keep on moving never dying.. Tunes that I can't hear. Would take me for a while my smile.. Fares that are too dear. I'd rather walk out another mile.. Then I heard a tune so right. It was in the dark of night. Just list'ning around ev'rywhere.. All the things I've wanted to do. Take so much time to get around to you.. Just reach out and catch and hold on. Leaving trails of dust and lust. Never even ly'ng or try'ng keep on moving never dying.. Smiles that I don't see. I'll make them up as I go on.. Laughs that just can't be. I'll make and laugh at ev'ry one.. Then I saw you in your place. With a laugh upon your face. Just looking around ev'rywhere.. All the things I've wanted to do. Take so much time to get around to you.. Just reach out and catch and hold on. Leaving trails of dust and lust. Never even ly'ng or try'ng keep on moving never dying.. Looking around with my feet on the ground. Full of words and of sound bringing smiles all around.. Satisfy me with your words that can be. Full of sound and I'll see I'm just looking around..
4149,The wretcheds in their millions. Will overspill their borders. And chaos then will reign in our Rael. Rael the home of my religion. To me the center of the Earth. The wretcheds in their millions. Will overspill their borders. And chaos then will reign in our Rael. My heritage is threatened. My roots are torn and cornered. And so to do my best I'll homeward sail. And so to do my best I'll homeward sail. Now Captain listen to my instructions. Return to this spot on Christmas Day. Look toward the shore for my signal. And then you'll know if in Rael I'll stay. If a yellow flag is fluttering. Sickly herald against the morn. Then you'll know my courage has ended. And you'll send your boat ashore. But if a red flag is flying. Brazen bold against the blue. Then you'll know that I am staying. And my yacht belongs to you. Now Captain listen to my instructions. Return to this spot on Christmas Day. Look toward the shore for my signal. And then you'll know if in Rael I'll stay. He's crazy if he thinks we're coming back again. He's crazy if he thinks we're coming back again. He's crazy if he thinks we're coming back again. He's crazy anyway. If a yellow flag is fluttering. Sickly herald against the morn. Then you'll know my courage has ended. And you'll send your boat ashore.
4150,I found your picture in a corporal's pocket. His cold fingers still pressed it to his chest. Sniper's bullet took his eyes and his breath away. Now he lies out in the forest with the rest. You looked shy in your grandmother's wedding dress. Feet set wide like a farm girl stands. Too young to love and too young to lose. In a cracked picture frame in a dead man's hands. I kept it with me for the luck for the magic. Maybe fate wouldn't strike in the same place twice. But something stirred and I dared to dream of you. And I knew I'd look for you if I should survive. Whe we stood down at last it was easy to find you. And mine was the shoulder you cried on that day. Just an old comrade doing his duty. Bringing the news from the woods of Darney. When I showed you the picture perhaps I felt jealousy. As your tears welled up with each reminisce. And my hands may be rougher and my tongue may be coarser. But I knew I could give you a love good as his. Now we lie in the darkness together. Often we lie without speaking this way. As you stare in the dark do you see your young corporal. Who never came back from the woods of Darney. Is it him that you see when we make love together?. Is it him that you see when war fills the sky?. Was he there as you stood in your grandmother's wedding dress. As we made our own vows you and I?. Now the bugle calls they say this is the big one. A curse on the life of a soldier you say. But don't you know that's a soldier's small comfort. For the bugle to sound and to hear and obey. And I'll carry your picture the one that he carried. I'll wear your innocence and take my chance. On a frozen field in a far-flung war. To win back what we lost in a field in France. And it's many a soldier who goes into battle. Your corporal and I we just hear and obey. Perhaps we'll lie in the darkness together. With your love to bind us in the woods of Darney
4151,Somewhere in the night. There's darkness there's light. And you're reaching within. To find where the sadness end. 'Cause maybe then I'll know. Why I always feel alone. I need something to hold. Something to call my own. Find a wishing well or a shooting star. Find a fairy tale that takes me so far. Away from here I just wanna feel more. 'Cause I've been waiting all my life. For a fire to burn and a lesson to learn. Nothing ever turns out right. But I still belive that someday I'll see. That it's never too late to find. Love in these eyes love in these eyes. Sometimes I get tired. It's like this road goes on to miles. And nobody knows how hard it is to smile smile. Find a wishing well or a shooting star. Find a fairy tale that takes me so far. Away from here I just wanna feel more. 'Cause I've been waiting all my life. For a fire to burn and a lesson to learn. Nothing ever turns out right. But I still belive that someday you'll see. That it's never too late as long as it takes. It's never too late to find. Love in these eyes. Someday I'll look in the mirror. And staring at me. Will be the person I am. And the person that I always thoght I could be. 'Cause I've been waiting all my life. For a fire to burn and a lesson to learn. And nothing ever turns out right. But I still belive that someday you'll see. That it's never too late as long as it takes. It's never too late to find. Love in these eyes in these eyes in these eyes. In these eyes. Love in these eyes in these eyes...

She sent angels around me so evil could not touch. I don't lie no more and I'm haunted when I fuck. Wealthy niggas with a conscience yeah you know what's up. The wires across and it's breeding a plague. The conscience is hungry and it's eating away. Trying to make sense of it but it's speedy in vain. Up all night with the books and you read till the day. But still ya house of diddy 'cause you got a little paper. Push a cat in the corner trust me it's the nature. Never underestimate the things-. you do. read your verse too inhale the oo and go. *Chorus*. (Man Singing). Don't Be afraid to look up the sky (x8). (ending)

Perspective pries your once weighty eyes and it gives you wings. I haven’t felt the way I feel today. In so long it’s hard for me to specify. I’m beginning to notice.

Deeper than the deepest Cousteau would ever go. Higher than the heights of what we often think we know. Blessed she who clearly sees the wood for the trees. To obtain a 'bird's eye' is to turn a blizzard to a breeze. I haven’t felt the way I feel today. In so long it’s hard for me to specify. I’m beginning to notice. How much this feels like a waking limb. Pins and needles nice to know you. Good-bye Nice to Know You. Good-bye Nice to Know You. Good-bye Nice to Know You. Good-bye Nice to Know You. To know.... you.

Yeah you can't call it love until you've loss. If you love someone this is what it costs. Sun light fading fast make it last. Sun light fading fast make it last

4185,"Stepping out onto the stage the smalltown star tonight. Flexes out for fame and fortune into the lights. The way she tears into the heart makes me realise. That I never understood hatred until I looked into those eyes. She cries ""No one's going to talk down to me again. No one's ever going to patronise me again. I'm going to get out of this town steal myself a crown. I'm going to get myself some power. If it's the last thing that I do"". Heading out of Bradford with a ticket on the train. And a faith as hard as steel and as sharp as any pain. Gets pictures in the papers smiling oh so good. While she lies in bed with racing dreams hot as blood. Because love will make you happy and love will keep you warm. And love will build a cushion to keep you safe from harm. But hate will drive you onwards hate will drive you upwards. Till you can get back all the bastards. Who ever tried to put you down. And when she's gone forever please don't lay her down to rest. In a quiet little churchyard along with all the rest. Throw a great big party to remember that she lived. Give her headlines on the TV to remember who she is. 'Cause no one's ever going to talk down to her again. No one's ever going to patronise her again. She's going to get out of this town steal herself a crown. She's going to get herself some power. If it's the last thing that she does. If it's the one thing that she does."

The jail on quiet nights. Young eyes contemplating somewhere to hide. Mankind will soon learn. That the end has come in time. Dividing lands retracing. All the borders will colide. Revealing ages when the absence. Of forgiveness rules our lives. Home how I go. My badge is wearing out. Written on the sand. Words to reconcile - unholy wars. Forgive us our father. For we have sinned. Blinded by pride. We know not what we do. Thy kingdom will be done. By holy wars. The battle is over. But the war still rages on!. Dividing lands retracing. All the borders will colide. Revealing ages when the absence. Of forgiveness rules our lives. Home how I go. My badge is wearing out. Written on the sand. Words to reconcile - unholy wars

Now Terry's dad understood. That this zero was no good. A tramp a thief and a liar. Well from out of the darkness. That breaks the dawn. Zero rode like twilight. He said ""Tonight's the night. Blind Terry come on. Terry come on. Tonight is the night. Pack your bags baby"". And together they ran like reindeers. Through the streets. Well like tomorrow the earth. Is gonna catch on fire. Now Terry's dad hired some troopers. To kill zero and bring Terry back home. They caught up in the night like firelightThem starlight troopers..... Zero marches through Terry's field. They met the Pythons down on Route Nine. But they refused to yield. Now the Pythons fought with blazed guns. And the troopers with swords of light. And Zero and Terry they ran away. And the gang fought all through the night. Now some folks say. Zero and Terry got away. Other said they were caught and brought back. Ah still young pilgrims to this day. Go to that spot way down by the railroad tracks. Where the troopers met the Pythons. Old timers cry on a hot August night. If you look hard enough if you try. You'll see Zero and Terry and all the Pythons. Just hiking them streets up in the sky.."

When I’m alone. Oh but my blessings get so blurred. At the sound of your words. I’m gonna need you to be patient with me. How can I warn you when my tongue turns to dust. Like we’ve discussed.

4211,For criminal acts and violence on the stage. For being a brat. Refusing to act your age. For all of the decent citizens you've enraged. You can go to Hell. For gambling and drinking alcohol constantly. For making us doubt our parents authority. For choosing to be a living obscenity. You can go to Hell. You're something that never should have happened. You even make your Grandma sick. You'd poison a blind man's dog and steal his cane. You'd gift-wrap a leper. And mail him to your Aunt Jane. You'd even force-feed a diabetic a candy cane. You can go to Hell. You're something that never should have happened. You even make your Grandma sick. For criminal acts and violence on the stage. For being a brat. Refusing to act your age. For all of the decent citizens you've enraged. You can go to Hell.
4212,Like an old man. Sitting alone at a lunch counter. Like a small town girl. A big city devours. Some of us laugh. Even in our darkest hour. Never leave lonely alone. Unspoken rules of solitude. Wound without a trace. A lifetime of dreams roll down your face. All that we can't say. Is all we need to hear. When you close your eyes. Does the world disappear. There's something in everyone. Only they know. It moves in the hidden ways. Of joy and sorrow. Never leave lonely alone
4213,The night is feeling cold now. And I must hold now my baby date. So glad to see you fine you're always on my mind. But before it gets too late. We can try love but if love is not enough. Then we can take a little walk. Just to find if our intentions are in time. Then I can make you baby see that. Lady tonight I am gonna make it happen. Lady tonight I'm gonna take this love to new heights. Lady tonight I'm gonna feel emotion. Maybe tonight I will love you and hold you tightly. Life is what you make it you must shake it to make it right. Time will always make you see if you believe. Then things will be alright. We'll try love and if love is not enough. We must be destined to be free. In time you'll feel like giving up. Then I must make you baby see that. (chorus).

And let my soul fly. And let my soul fly. Let it go. Pavement beneath my feet. I watch the white lines fly. Nothing between us here but the black blue sky. Suspended up in the air like a still life. Suspended up in the air like a still life. Let it go. I believe you're the fire that could burn me clean

How long how how long baby how long?. I feel disgusted I feel so bad. Thinking 'bout the good time that I once had had. How long how how long baby how long?. I could see the green grass growing on the hill. I ain't seen no greenback on a dollar bill. How long how how long baby how long?. You're gonna be sorry you feel so blue. When you want me baby I declare I want want you. How long how how long baby how long?. Don't have no money for to ride the train. I would ride the rugs baby to be with you again.

4226,No feeling when you told me goodbye. No reason when youâ€™re living a lie. Donâ€™t tell me what I already know. Iâ€™m living memories of long ago. I fool myself I deny it all. Wanna hide it away. Lost moments never caring enough. I was never good at playing it tough. Still living in my own little world. Still believing youâ€™re the only one. Itâ€™s always hard never easier. To face another day alone. Every time it rains I fall apart. I start to remember. Every single time it rains. I think of you.. . (Rankin). Bob â€˜nâ€™ Weave Music.
4227,Hard and cold like a street of gold. It's easy to find but so hard to hold.. Smooth and strong but it won't last long. When the rust sets in she'll be good as gone!. Concrete Concrete and steel.. It's like concrete.. Hey baby what's the deal?. A heart of stone make you feel alone. but what can you do when your hand is blown?. Hard as ice it's like tumblin' dice. before you fall for her boy you better think twice.. Concrete Concrete and steel.. It's like concrete.. Hey baby what's the deal?. Dark as night diamond bright. Never seen such a strange delight.. Slick as glass and just as fast. You'll feel the pain but it won't last..

4232,I must've dreamed a thousand dreams. Been haunted by a million screams. But I can hear the marching feet. They're moving into the street. Now did you read the news today. They say the danger's gone away. But I can see the fire's still alight. They're burning into the night. Too many men too many people. Making too many problems. And not much love to go round. Can't you see this is the land of confusion. This is the world we live in. And these are the hands we're given. Use them and let's start trying. To make it a place worth living in. Oh Superman where are you now. Everything's gone wrong somehow. The men of steel men of power. Are losing control by the hour. This is the time this is the place. So we look for the future. But there's not much love to go round. Tell me why this is the land of confusion. This is the world we live in. And these are the hands we're given. Use them and let's start trying. To make it a place worth living in. I remember long ago. Oh when the sun shining. And all the stars were bright all through the night. And the wake up this madness as I held you tight. So long ago. I won't be coming home tonight. My generation will put it right. We're not just making promises. That we know we'll never keep. Too many men too many people. Making too many problems. And not much love to go round. Can't you see this is the land of confusion. This is the world we live in. And these are the hands we're given. Use them and let's start trying. To make it a place worth fighting for. This is the world we live in. And these are the names we're given. Stand up and let's start showing. Just where our lives are going to

4244,You can't have the flower without the root. you can't have the fire without the soot. Even a stripper needs her red tasseled suit. and we were meant to be.

An apple needs pits the way melons need seed. your foot needs your arm and your arm needs your knee. And one of these days I know you will need me. we were meant to be ooohhh we were meant to be.

4245,Why do I try - sometimes I need reasons. For leaving songs after I stop breathing. Long after I'm gone - what greater gift will be there. If I struggle if I dig deep go every night without sleep. Torturin' myself till I give every piece away and there's nothing left.. Till I don't wanna talk I don't wanna fuck. I just wanna shoot up into space where I can blow up. Into pieces that float into nowhere - I wanna go there. Where I won't know care where I won't know existence. Resistance for an instance for a moment. We can fight but every moment will always be lost.. I can't believe what you're sayin' now. Nothing is real except for pain now. Life is a deal I never made now. Tossed into skin - I need a way out. I had to blow my brains out. No matter how we spend our time. Every tick of the clock counting down. We lose our minds trying to find a way. To make it all stop - climbing for years. Out of fear that we won't reach the top. My hands are numb and I need to just drop. I can't believe what you're sayin' now. Nothing is real except for pain now. Life is a deal I never made now. Tossed into skin - I need a way out. I had to blow my brains out. I need a way out
4246,Sitting on your throne you rest your pretty bones. Don't act like you're alive. Take another chance to do this on my own. But you will let it die. Feels like a lifetime living in this pain. A whole world passes me by. Losing the daylight but I must admit. That you're suiting for this lie. Another lie. We will fight back through your broken past. and you fade away. Throw the first stone. We will arrive through till you don't believe. Fear hate love. Take it to your grave. Fear hate love. Take it to your grave. Everyday you grind your teeth and spit our blood. Dripping down from your own life. Swinging from the axe it crashes and it hits. So I'll not even try. Even try. We will fight back through your broken past. and you fade away. Throw the first stone. We will arrive through [?] till you don't believe. Say goodbye to the world you know. Say goodbye to your mask of hope. We will fight back through your broken past. and you fade away. Throw the first stone. Save your words this only time. To kill the way you made me. So save your words I'm moving on. There's only hate within me. You're finally my enemy. The time has come for you to know. Just save your words this only time. To kill the life you gave me. I won't go back. We will fight back through your broken past. and you fade away. Throw the first stone. We will arrive through [?] till you don't believe. Say goodbye to the world you know. Say goodbye to your mask of hope. We will fight back through your broken past. and you fade away. Fear hate love. Take it to your grave. Fear hate love. Take it to your grave

4249,Setting sun deals hands of gold. There's velvet eyes in Mexico. Just a fall away. And all she said was true. Speak in tongues speak in lies. Drooling livers born to die. It's a wonder that those guns don't point at you. [chorus:]. Keep sayin go on keep sayin go on keep sayin you won't live forever. Point and shoot I know just what you mean. In a world that's full of shit and gasoline baby. One dog's dead one's on the phone. Just leave a lung or leave it alone. It's that same on song again. I hate it cause it's true

Our sacred stage. Has been defaced. Replaced to grace. The marketplace. Dow is jonesing at the bit. 42nd Disney Street. Ragged hearts unraveling. Look out kids. The gleam the gleam. All that glitters. Is not all that glitters. Is not all that glitters

Scream away my mental health. Can I ask a question. To help me save me from myself. Enemies fill up the pages. Are they me. Monday till Sunday in stages. Set me free.

Longs at the others that I hold so close. Thought to be killed then when? by who?. Youâ€™ve been a bad boy. You broke all the rules. Youâ€™ve been a bad boy. Youâ€™ll get yours paid in full. My robot will never die. My robot will never die. You look down and far from out. And the pain the reeds you lose. My robot will never die.

4290,Sunshine. Are you outside?. I am a simpleton by choice. not speaking to hear my voice. Sunshine. Why are you sleeping?. Gotta get outside. Cover the ground on foot. Not hitching around your spur. Over the river and trough the woods. I've come this far to bring in the goods. I get high even when I don't try. Let 'em pass by with a wink to the eye. I reserve the right to be stoned. I reserve the right to take it to collect them sums I have the right. Don't try to be there's really no point in you biting me. I'm glad to see that it's easy for me to be an MC. Let me tell you a little story. Like my dog Bobby he hated the pool man. So I tried to play Kotter and make things cool. And I said just let him smell you hold out your hand. He reached it on out and then bam. He bit him he bit him so fuckin' hard. Blood was steady gushin' all over my back yard. I kept apologizing I felt so fuckin' bad. The dude was so cool he didn't even get mad. He said man don't sweat it that's the dog's meaning. Took some Neosporin and went back to his cleaning. Thought I had a dream or else it was a movie. Your mind can have a joint easy like jungle boogie. $600 freebie and I gots my job. Would you mind come but I gots my dog. Come you can foam the water with the bone. I wanna tell my mom ring her on the phone. Cherry popsicle icy cold freezing. Loves on his gums now that he is teething. Got a wee-wee pass lay them by the door. Nasty Little shits he dropped them on the floor. Sunshine. Are you outside?. I am a simpleton by choice. Not speaking to hear my voice. Sunshine. Why are you sleeping?. Gotta get outside.

You won't believe these words from me. But still they're mine to say. I will always love you. In my own crazy way. I tried to keep my sanity. By being someone else. Someone that you could hold on to.

That could make a woman's heart sing. forgive me. And darling if I brought you any pain. I'm trying to explain. In my heart I was always true. The memories of you and me. Are written on the wind.

The fire keeps on burning you're waiting in the cold. Down in the hole down in the hole. Dark and bloody autumn pierces my heart. The memory of your kiss tears me apart. The sky above is turning the world below's gone gray. I thought that I could turn and walk away. But the fire keeps on burning and I'm working in the cold. Down in the hole down in the hole.

I got nothing but heart and sky and sunshine. the things you left behind. I wake to find my city's gone to black. Days just keep on falling. Your voice keeps on calling. I'm going to dig right here until I get you back. The fires keep on burning. I'm here with you in the cold. Down in the hole down in the hole

4311,"Now just because your pretty and you think you're mighty wise. You tell me that you love me then you roll those big brown eyes. When I saw you last week your eyes were turnin' black. Go find the guy that beat you up - ask him to take you back. Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me. I can tell you've been out on a spree. Well it's plain that you're lyin'. When you say that you've been cryin'. Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me. I used to spend my money to make you look real sweet. I wanted to be proud of you when we walked down the street. Now don't ask me to dress you up in satin and in silk. Your eyes look like two cherries in a glass of bottled milk. Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me. I can tell you've been out on a spree. Well it's plain that you're lyin'. When you say that you've been cryin'. Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me. So I guess our little romance has finally simmered down. You should join the circus you make a real good clown. Your eyes look like a roadmap I'm scared to smell your breath. You better shut your peepers before you bleed to death. Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me. I can tell you've been out on a spree. Well it's plain that you're lyin'. When you say that you've been cryin'. Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me. Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me. From the album ""True Love""."
4312,INSTRUMENTAL. I've had nothing but bad luck. Since the day I saw the cat at my door.. So I came here to you sweet lady. Answering your mystical call.. Crystal ball on the table. Showing the future the past.. Same cat with them evil eyes. And I knew it was a spell she’d cast.. She's just a devil woman. With evil on her mind.. Beware the devil woman. She's gonna get you.. She's just a devil woman. With evil on her mind.. Beware the devil woman. She's gonna get you from behind.. INSTRUMENTAL. Give me the ring on your finger. Let me see the lines on your hand. I can see me a tall dark stranger. Giving you what you hadn't planned.. I drank the potion she offered me. I found myself on the floor. Then I looked in those big green eyes. And I wondered what I'd come there for.. She's just a devil woman. With evil on her mind.. Beware the devil woman. She's gonna get you.. She's just a devil woman. With evil on her mind.. Beware the devil woman. She's gonna get you from behind.. INSTRUMENTAL. If you're out on a moonlit night. Be careful of them neighbourhood strays. Of a lady with long black hair. Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways.. Crystal ball on the table. Showing the future the past.. Same cat with them evil eyes. You'd better get out of there fast.. She's just a devil woman. With evil on her mind.. Beware the devil woman. She's gonna get you.. She's just a devil woman. With evil on her mind.. Beware the devil woman. She's gonna get you.. She's just a devil woman. With evil on her mind.. Beware the devil woman. She's gonna get you.. She's just a devil woman. With evil on her mind.. Beware the devil woman. She's gonna get you.. She's just a devil woman. With evil on her mind.. Beware the devil woman. She's gonna get you.

4315,O spread the tidings round. Wherever a man is found. Wherever human hearts and human woes abound. Let every Christian tongue proclaim the joyful sound;. The Comforter has come.. The long night has past. The morning breaks at last. And hushed the dreadful wail and fury of the blast. As over the golden hills the day advances fast. The Comforter has come.. The Comforter has come.. O boundless love divine. How shall this tongue of mine. To wondering mortals tell the matchless grace divine. That I a child of hell in His image shine. The Comforter has come.. The Comforter has come.. The Comforter has come.
4316,All my love is around me. Like virgins clean today. Waist deep in the water. Pushing my body away. A wall makes me go. To pull past to me. Oh how many drops can you squeeze out to explain. What happened Monday?. Here one of them stay behind. And tell me from afar. I saw how I slither. Like colors in the dark. But when dark kisses me. I was half a world away. It seems shorty is my bred. As I turn to say. When we'll meet another way. You won't recognize my face. When we'll meet one way. You're nothing you won't. You won't speak up speak up speak up. When we'll meet one way. You won't recognize my face. When we'll meet one way. You're nothing you won't. You won't speak up speak up speak up. And one day it suits me. The next it bleeds me dry. It plays out like you're out of time. Before the morning light. How beautiful it was to be anything at all. But somehow it strikes me. That time can't beat all. When we'll meet another way. You won't recognize my face. When we'll meet one way. You're nothing you won't. You won't speak up speak up speak up. When we'll meet one way. You won't recognize my face. When we'll meet one way.

4318,(R. Hall E. King G. Rossington). . I snuck around the corner he had his guard down. I threw the first punch that's when he hit the ground. To survive in the street you gotta win the first round. 'Cause if you want eat you gotta be the baddest one around. I'm a backstreet crawler. Daddy paid for college I earned a degree. Got a job up on Wall Street. Where I learned to make the little man bleed. That's when I got stomped like a cattle stampede. Had a nervous breakdown all my friends and family left me. (chorus). Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler. When you see them on the concrete it's their spirit that's harder. Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler. Where your ego meets defeat and your pride can't get no smaller. Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler. Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler. (repeat). I guess you might say it sure is a shame. I used to have everything oh how my life has changed. Yeah I'm broken and torn I've never been free. Lost everything that meant a thing to me. (repeat chorus).

And take a look at what we offer. DDT poisoning me changing my relativity. What's it going to be. Later I think I'll disappear into another room. And take a look inside the till. Lovely days human ways journeys that take us to the end. Haven't we always been here. Sharing one love and one fear. Some day you'll know that life is really really all about you. So come and look inside. You'll be surprised to find. Later I think I'll disappear into another womb. And take a look inside the mens' room. Haven't I given you everything that I could give. Where do you live. You are the only censor.. If you don't like what I say you have a. choice. You can turn me off... If you don't like what I say you have a choice.. You can turn me off...

4346,"She wears a wedding ring her sister lent. To throw them off the scent. Just let them guess it's what they expect. Who in the world has bitten her neck?. She's discovered wearing last night's dress. The carnal and cunning she couldn't express. Who do you think she's trying to impress?. CHORUS:. I think you'd better hold your tongue. Although you've never been that strong. I'm sorry to say that I knew all along. You're no match for that sulky girl. She left her European town. Before she let the family down. She couldn't stand the Massacre Game. So she dyed her hair and adopted another name. With the evidence of passing out stamped on her hand. She glows in the dark. He thinks she's from another planet. CHORUS. Sulky girl. I'm sure you look a picture when you cry. Threatening the silent treatment doesn't qualify. It's like money in the bank. Your expression is blank. But while the chance appears. You'll be nearer to tears. Sulky girl [2x]. He said ""Hello my pretty flower"". Just trying out his tycoon power. Avoiding the mirror her pitying stare. She said ""You're mistaken your money's no good in here"". Just some stupid little know-it-all. Who thought she looked easy; he's not that astute. He'll pay for the distance. Between cruelty and beauty. CHORUS. So I won't tell you again. What do you gain. By blackening her name. She's smarter than you. Oh isn't it a shame. You're gonna lose that sulky girl. Sulky girl. I saw you practising your blackmail faces. Suddenly you're talking like a duchess. But you're still a waitress. I saw through your pretence. But in my DEFENSE. There are a few events. I think will spare the censor."

4357,I went out to the club the other night. To you know dance with my bitches. That guy was there again. He's like. I'm sorry for what I said last weekend. I told him I didn't mind which was a lie. But I was equally sorry. And I didn't want to apologize. It was just a drunk text. In my head I was writing a fiction of us. Behind my eyes I was begging for. Things my lips could never ask. And my mouth kept pouring. Desperate clauses of random intent. He asked me if he could text me later. After the club. He hands me another shot of vodka. And I say sure. I'm on the dance floor when I get a text from adam. I'm too lazy to type so I send him a photo I took up a dancer's skirt. And tell him to come and get it. Not realizing what I had just said. Later on she comes up to me. Holds up her phone screaming at me and I say. I'm sorry it was just a drunk text. I should've known they knew each other. No one is safe in the twitter sphere anymore. You take the word sex and mix it with texting. It's called sexting. When you add drunk sexting. The words just don't make sense. It's a hot mess of misspelled obscenities. Body parts run on questions. I'm not sure what it means to ask. I get a text from my best friend. She's upstairs getting bottle service. She's like. This guy wants you to wet your lips with this bottle. He wants me to bring more girls up. Like he's some kind of pimp. Are you fucking kidding me?. It's just another moment. When one stupid reply can lead to the walk of shame. And I'll be damned if I end up in some lame diner after this. With last night's lingerie in my purse. It's just a drunk text. It's just a drunk text. This is the last time I ever drink and text. It's jut a drunk text. It's just a drunk text
4358,(G. Rossington E. King J. Van Zant D. Tate). Are you a saint then don't be a stranger. Were you sent down from Heaven to show me the way. And if you ain't then I see a danger. You better take a minute and hear what I've got to say. (chorus). 'Cause I'll keep on tryin' to put it straight to you. You better give it straight to me. 'Cause most women seem to have a good time. Makin' a fool out of me. I'm keepin' my faith I've made up my mind. I've got nothin' left to lose just lay it on the line. I'm keepin' my faith yea I'll find the one. Who won't steal me blind who won't turn and run. I'm keepin' my faith I'm trustin' in you. So don't treat me like those other ones do. Ain't no gettin' 'round it tell me to my face. Do you think I'm a fool for keepin' my faith in you. I'll treat you right I'll do you better. I won't disappoint you I won't make you cry. My friends tell me if you let her. She'll empty your pockets she'll spend you dry. (repeat chorus twice).
4359,When that I was and a little tiny boy. With a Hey-ho. The wind and the rain. A foolish thing was but a toy. For the rain it raineth. Every day. But when I came to man's estate. With a Hey-ho. The wind and the rain. 'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate. For the rain it raineth. Every day. But when I came alas to wife. With a Hey-ho. The wind and the rain. By swaggering I could never fright. For the rain it raineth. Every day. But when I came unto my bed. With a Hey-ho. The wind and the rain. With tosspots still a drunken head. For the rain it raineth. Every day. A great while ago the world began. With a Hey-ho. The wind and the rain. But that's all one our play is done. And we'll strive to please you. Every day.

(Too tight). (Too tight). Yeah don't try to reel me in. With all those charm school looks. I've seen it all a thousand times. I sung that song I wrote that fucking book. Do yourself a favor now. Don't drive me 'round the block. Let's split another bottle now. Let's take a hit loosen up. Don't get too tight on me. 'Cause I'm I'm bound so tight I can't breathe. We'll watch the sun go down.

4366,"The wild mountain thyme that grows around my door. Has grown there for two score years or more. And I've grown weary waiting for love to say. ""Come my way come my way."". The brook that sings and twinkles in the sun. Has danced this mercy dance since time begun. But o how weary and how long the day will he say. ""Come my way."". Lovers all around I wish you joy. Happiness to every girl and boy.. But sometimes spare a thought of me and say."
4367,I sense there's something in the wind. That feels like tragedy's at hand. And though I'd like to stand by him. Can't shake this feeling that I have. The worst is just around the bend. And does he notice my feelings for him?. And will he see how much he means to me?. I think it's not to be. What will become of my dear friend?. Where will his actions lead us then?. Although I'd like to join the crowd. In their enthusiastic cloud. Try as I may it doesn't last. And will we ever end up together?. no I think not it's never to become. For I am not the one

4379,"Written by Warren Zevon 1973 Warner-Tamerlane Publishing Corp./Darkroom Music BMI. How're you going to make your way in the world. When you weren't cut out for working. When your fingers are slender and frail. How're you going to get around. In this sleazy bedroom town. If you don't put yourself up for sale. Where will you go with your scarves and your miracles. Who's gonna know who you are. Drugs and wine and flattering light. You must try it again till you get it right. Maybe you'll end up with someone different every night. All these people with no home to go home to. They'd all like to spend the night with you. Maybe I would too. But tell me. How're you going to make your way in the world woman. When you weren't cut out for working. And you just can't concentrate. And you always show up late. You said you were an actress. Yes I believe you are. I thought you'd be a star. So I drank up all the money. Yes I drank up all the money. With these phonies in this Hollywood bar. These friends of mine in this Hollywood bar. Loneliness and frustration. We both came down with an acute case. And when the lights came up at two. I caught a glimpse of you. And your face looked like something. Death brought with him in his suitcase. Your pretty face. It looked so wasted. Another pretty face. Devastated. The French Inhaler. He stamped and mailed her. ""So long Norman"". She said ""So long Norman""."
4380,Leave all behind now to watch her crawl. Through our dark gardens of insanity. She’ll be the light to guide you back home. Just give her a kiss worth dying for. And open your arms. Watch me fall for you my venus doom. Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed. My venus doom. All dreams are of you. My venus doom. Grieve all your hearts out and she’ll writhe enthralled. In tragic ecstatic agony. And in her flames we will die some more. Just show me a life worth living for. And light up the dark. Hold me inside your infernal offering. Touch me as I fall. Don’t lose yourself in this suffering yet. Hold on
4381,You're unsure and you're not ready. so that must mean I want you. You're unavailable and disinterested. and to you I look for comfort. A million times in a million ways. I will try to change you. A million months and a million days. I'll try to convince you. I have waited for you and adjusted for you. and I'm done. I have deferred to you and enabled you. and I'm done. You're too young or you're too old or. you're simply not inclined. You're asleep or you're withholding. be that my cue to crave you. Several times in several ways. I'll try to squeeze love from you. Several hours and several ways. I'll feast on scraps thrown from you. I have bent for you and I've deprived for you. and I'm done.

It won't be long before I am reclaimed. It won't take long and I'll be on path again. It won't be easy for us to disengage. I'm at the end of self deprivation stage. You're afraid of every woman. afraid of your inner workings. You cringe at the thought of living under the same. roof as me god and everything. A million times and a million ways. I've tried to alter to match you. Several times every several days. I've tried to uncrush on you. I have waited for you and adjusted for you. and I'm done. I have deferred to you and enabled you. and I'm done. I have bent for you and I've deprived for you. and I'm done. I have depressed for you and contorted for you. and I'm done
4383,It didn't happen for you.. No one wants to hear the truth. Coming from three political queers. Plucking the punk rock groove.. So you break up the band. And leave us all in toe. And now we gotta figure out where to go.. I caught it at a rave. (did it give you a vaccination?). I saw it on my tv. (did it lighten up your load?). And every fcuking dj. (did you feel affiliated?). Was telling me i'm free. (like you really had a home?). I'm free to be a loser. (were the ticket prices too high?). I'm free to be a trend. (were the lights too bright?). I'm free to be a backlash over and over. And over again. (was it all a bunch of hype?). You said i'm losing inspiration. one band at a time. Cos i gotta know there's someone somewhere out there. Singing for our side.. I come up - share the mortar and the glue.. What we build together - we share that too.. And the wind may come and the rain may fall. But we stand together or we don't stand at all.. And i said where are you going to now. Now that the going is gone?. Where are you going to now?. And it's a race to your survival. Swimming up the stream. Crossing over one dam after another. Until we get to rock and roll heaven's gate.. I caught it at a rave. (did it give you a vaccination?). I saw it on the tv. (did it lighten up your load?). And every fcuking dj. (did you feel affiliated?). Was telling me i'm free. (like you really had a home?). I'm free to be a loser. (were the ticket prices too high?). I'm free to be a trend. (were the lights too bright?). I'm free to be a backlash over and over. Until i get to rock and roll heaven's gate.
4384,Wriggles from his captor's arms. Mr speaker gets the word and. Running now from the alarms. Speaks his mind free as a bird. Free now to roam around. Stand up straight when he quotes. Spread the word that he has found. Books of verse and scribbled notes. Mister speaker gets the word. (To tell the secrets he has heard). Speaks so fast his words are slurred. (Mister speaker gets the word). Stands up straight outside my door. I bring you now the words I've learned. To whom it may concern senor. Tell my friends I have returned. Mister speaker gets the word. (To tell the secrets he has heard). Speaks so fast his words are slurred. (Mister speaker gets the word). Excitement rages through his brain. Stirred and stirred throughout the years. Not enough time to explain. Eyes of many sighs of fear. Making space from Colney Hatch Lane. Just some poetry my friend. Scuttles past my window frame. Vanishes right round the bend. Mister speaker gets the word. (To tell the secrets he has heard). Speaks so fast his words are slurred. (Mister speaker gets the word).
4386,All my devotion betrayed. I am no longer afraid. I was too blinded to see. How much you've stolen from me. You want to know why. I feel so horrified. I've let my innocence die. You want to know why. I can't be pacified. You made me bury something. I won't be sleeping tonight. I only wanted a blessing made. Now I've been labeled a renegade. It seems so clear now what I must do. You're no immortal I won't let them. Deify you. They view you as the new messiah. Deify you. Renew belief in some demented man. You want to know why. It seems the passion's died. We've all been living this lie. You want to know why. My will's been fortified. You made me hunger again. Good luck sleeping tonight. I only wanted a blessing made. Now I've been labeled a renegade. It seems so clear now what I must do. You're no immortal. I won't let them. Deify you. They view you as the new messiah. Deify you. Renew belief in some demented man. All my devotion betrayed. I am no longer afraid. All my devotion betrayed. I am no longer afraid. I was too blinded to see. How much you've stolen from me. I was too blinded to see. All my devotion betrayed. I am no longer afraid. I was too blinded to see. How much you've stolen from me. Deify you. They view you as the new messiah. Deify you.

I'm just a grain of sand walking in a sea of people. I look around me and my name is just someone. For a moment in time I belong. Where my heart beats the fear is gone. Like destiny. So move with me I'm strong enough. To be weak in your arms. Move with me I'm strong enough. To be real in your arms. Whispering as I was driving. Quietly the car was rolling. Like a bullet. I was feeling the speed moving. Me faster. Addicted to the rhythm. On my ghetto blaster. That's me supposing. That the clarity of thought. Is clear enough to think. It's real enough to touch. The wind on me got me tripping. Can I keep you next to me. Till the end of the world. Like the joker on the pile. Never coming or going. The colour of my true cards was showing. Keeping in touch with an idea. That I been growing. Trust trust I must trust. With my head on my chest.

4422,Everything fell to pieces. When my eyes met yours. In that hospital gown. And the dreams we once were dreaming. That we held so close. Felt impossible now. And all the plans we held for the future. And all the memories up from the past. The world I once knew. Was in a cardboard box. In the lobby lost and found. Hallelujah nevertheless was the song the pain couldn't destroy. Hallelujah nevertheless You're my joy invincible. Joy invincible joy. Tears were in my eyes when the phone rings. If only life didn't need us to be this brave. But we don't live in the world of if only's. Stretched tight in between our birth and our graves. Hallelujah nevertheless. Open your eyes. Look to the skies. We are the children of the promise. Hold to what's real. Everything heals. We are the children of the promise. Open your heart. Look for the sparks. We are the children of the promise. Love is your place. Feel the light on your face. We are the children of the promise. Hallelujah nevertheless was the song the pain couldn't destroy. Hallelujah nevertheless You're my joy invincible. Joy invincible joy. Tears were in my eyes when the phone rings. If only life didn't need us to be this brave. But we don't live in the world of if only's. Stretched tight in between our birth and our graves. Hallelujah nevertheless. Tears were in my eyes when the phone rings. Maybe it's Your joy that's giving me strength. You're my joy invincible. Joy invincible joy

4426,"I remember now but I still have my doubts. I think it's gonna be today. Everybody came but it's just not the same. Why did it have to be today?. Now my chest is tight – no I am not all right. It doesn't have to be this way. Why does it have to be this way?. I don't know what's wrong. It's like I'm too far gone. It doesn't matter anyway. Fear is in my heart – just when I stop it starts. And I can never live this way. Freedom in a cage – no sun and too much rage. I don't know how much I can take. Push it down inside but it knows just where I hide. I know that ""normal"" is hard to fake. Bleeding into life – it's like a thousand knives. Are slowly turning me to this. Why does it have to be like this?. I don't know what's wrong. It's like I'm too far gone. It doesn't matter anyway. Fear is in my heart – just when I stop it starts. And I can never live this way. I lost again today.... I don't know what's wrong. It's like I'm too far gone. It doesn't matter anyway. Fear is in my heart – just when I stop it starts. And I can never live this way. Living with a curse sometimes it's even worse. It slowly kills me everyday. Something I despise is gonna take my life. I guess I'll try again today"

4429,You know I'll be the one when you want me to. I always get the call when she's done with you. Maybe it's time I opened my eyes. Always feel the fool when you lie to me. You seem to make it up so easily. What's worse is that I let you every time. I wish that I could tell you. You only ever let me down but what I need from you right now. Just try to look me in the eye and baby tell me. Why do you hate love? (hate hate hate love). Hate love hate hate hate love. Hate love hate hate hate love. (hate hate). I wonder do you hate love? (hate hate hate love). Hate love hate hate hate love. Hate love hate hate hate love. (hate hate). You like to glamour me baby you do it well. I smile when I'm angry but you'll never tell. I hear your lips moving I don't hear a sound. I think you think I like it when you make me hurt. Sometimes I hate myself because sometimes it works. And I can never bring myself to talk you down. I wish that I could tell you. You only ever let me down but what I need from you right now. Just try to look me in the eye and baby tell me. Why do you hate love? (hate hate hate love). Hate love hate hate hate love. Hate love hate hate hate love. (hate hate). I wonder do you hate love? (hate hate hate love). Hate love hate hate hate love. Hate love hate hate hate love. (hate hate). If I wanted this to be something less than rational. Somewhere lost to in between I could let myself go. Now I need to make this right. Get myself on track tonight. Before I do something I might. Make you wonder why do I?. Hate love hate hate hate love. Hate love hate hate hate love. Hate love hate hate hate love. It's no wonder that I hate love I hate hate hate love. Hate love I hate hate hate love. Hate love I hate hate hate love. (hate hate). And now you know why I hate love. (hate love)
4430,by Warren Zevon c. 1991 Zevon Music/BMI. Don't the sky look funny. Don't it look kinda chewed-on like. Don't you feel like running. Don't you feel like running from the dawn's early light. Quite ugly one morning. We all said goodnight. It came without a warning. Just a flash of light. Don't you feel kind of funny. Don't you feel kind of funny inside. When you feel like laughing. And everybody tells you you ought to be crying. Quite ugly one morning. We all said goodnight. It came without a warning. But it was quite all right. Quite ugly one morning. We all said goodnight. It came without a warning. But it was quite all right. From dawn to sundown. It's a long long way. And it's a hollow triumph. When you make it to the bottom of another day. There's a fever rising. When the evening comes. And when the battle's over. There'll be nothing left but the sound of drums. Quite ugly one morning. We all said goodnight. It came without a warning. Just a flash of light. Quite ugly one morning. We all said goodnight. It came without a warning. But it was quite all right.
4432,Well he shines like a penny in a little kid's hand. When he's out on a Saturday night. He's a real go-getter and the best two-stepper you'll see. But when I'm sittin' alone at a table for two.

4448,That feeling that doesn't go away just did. And I walked a thousand miles to prove it. And I'm caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts. The colour of my blood is all I see on the rocks. As you sail from me. Alarms will ring for eternity. The waves will break every chain on me. My bones will bleach... my flesh will flee. So help my lifeless frame to breathe. And god knows I'm not dying but I breathe now. And god knows it's the only way to heal now. With all the blood I lost with you. It drowns the love I thought I knew. The lost dreams I buried in my sleep for him. And this was the ecstacy of love forgotten. And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets. And my blood is all I see. As you steal my soul from me. Alarms will ring for eternity. The waves will break every chain on me. And god knows I'm not dying but I breathe now. And god knows it's the only way to heal now. With all the blood I lost with you. It drowns the love I thought I knew

4454,Giving you more of what for. Always worked for me before. Now I'm a shabby doll. What's going on behind the green elevator door. With just a shabby doll. There's a hit man facing. A compromising situation. With just a shabby doll. And a very neat line in character assassination. She's just a shabby doll. She's just a shabby doll. She's putting him off and putting you on. She's just the shabby doll. You're swearing upon you know in your heart. She's gone you know in your heart. She's just a shabby doll. There's a girl in this dress. There's always a girl in distress. She's just a shabby doll. She's so sure she's self-possessed. Then again she's half undressed. She's just a shabby doll. The boy that I used to be. Showed no sign of sympathy. For just a shabby doll. I have betrayed you and me. And paid for my own bribery. With just a shabby doll. (chorus). He's the tired toy that everyone enjoyed. He wants to be a fancy man but he's nothing but a nancy boy. He's all pride and no joy. And being what you might call a whore. Always worked for me before. Now I'm a shabby doll. Untie the gag the cat's out of the bag. But won't show his claws. He's just a shabby doll. She said you must be joking. Some things are left unspoken. You're just a shabby doll. He's lying limp and soaking. He was openly broken. By just a shabby doll.
4456,Offer my hand you spit in my face. Blinded by failures you can't face the shame. The walls of your fortress come tumbling down. You cry for a savior no ones around. Paint me a picture of how things went wrong. 'cause this violence play your favorite song. Swim through the void as black as your soul. Never forget. You've lost control of me. Never change who I am. Lies will never hide the truth. Pain is a blessing in disguise. I shiver at the thought of you. Now I'll see you on your way. As you fall from grace. Glued to the past a moth to a flame. Where will you hide. When you can't shift the blame. The further you fall the more that I gain. Never forget you've caused this pain. You feel. Burning deep inside of you. Behind the veil. Never take control of me. Never change who I am. Lies will never hide the truth. Pain is a blessing in disguise. I shiver at the thought of you. Now I'll see you on your way. As you fall from grace. No. You will never change. No no. You will never change. No. You will never change. No no. You will never change. You've lost control of me. Never change who I am. Lies will never hide the truth. Pain is a blessing in disguise. I shiver at the thought of you. Now I'll see you on your way. As you fall from grace

4466,The strands in your eyes. That colour them wonderfull. Stop me then steal my breath. Esmeralds from mountains. Thrust towards the sky. Never revealing their depth. Tell me what we belong together. Dress it up with the trappings of love. I'll be captivated. I'll hang from your lips. Instead of the gallows of heartache. That hang from above. I'll be your crying shoulder. I'll be love's suicide. I'll be better when I'm older. I'll be the greatest fan of your life. And rain falls angry on the tin roof. As we lie awake in my bed.

4468,Tore it up again I couldn't stop again. Letting go till there was nothing in the way. Fuck the feeling then I cave in again. Sweet surrender to the angel I deny. When you came to life I was terrified. I knew that nothing else would ever feel the same. Doubt came over me; what kind of father would I be?. Another time I could stand up and be a man. To change a face in my life. Your future and mine. Time to do what is right. A new beginning. The world around me died. When I saw that heartbeat. I knew it wasn't a sin. Can someone tell me why. This has happened to me?. Why was it only in death. Would you redeem my child?. No serenity within agony. Every day brings on. A hundred ways to fight. Constant scrutiny. I can feel you judging me. Resurrecting every demon that's inside. The priest was horrified. You struggled still alive. That one desire was. The dream I sought for yours. Grief crippled me the reaper cheated me. Left me early for the path I'd come to adore. To change a face in my life. Your future and mine. Time to do what is right. A new beginning. The world around me died. When I saw that heartbeat. I knew it wasn't a sin. Can someone tell me why. This has happened to me?. Why was it only in death. Would you redeem my child?. My child. The world around me died. When I saw that heartbeat. I knew it wasn't a sin. Can someone tell me why. This has happened to me?. Why was it only in death. Would you redeem my child?. I pray you will redeem my child.. . By:Isabela :*
4469,Ain't it the truth. Ain't it the truth now baby. Ain't it the truth now. What I say?. Eat watermelon. Eat peaches and cream. Eat ripe tomatoes. You know what I mean.. Ain't it the truth.

4473,As I sit and close my eyes. There's peace in my mind. And I'm hoping that you'll find it too. And these feelings in my heart. I know are meant for you. Meant for you.
4474,"Get away from me. This isn't gonna be easy. But I don't need you. Believe me. You got a piece of me. But it's just a little piece of me. But I don't need anyone. And these days I feel like I'm fading away. Like sometimes when I hear myself on the radio. Have you seen me latley?. I was out on the radio starting to change. Somewhere out in america. It's starting to rain. Could you tell me one thing you remember about me. And have you seen me lately?. I remember me. And all the little things. That make up a memory. Like she said she loved to watch me sleep. Like she said. ""it's the breathing. It's the breathing in and out and in and..."". Have you seen me latley?. I was out on the radio starting to change. Somewhere out in america. It's starting to rain. Could you tell me the things you remember about me. And have you seen me lately?. I guess I thought that someone would notice. I guess I thought somebody would say something. If I was missing. Can't you see me?. Come on color me in. Come on color me in. Give me your blue rain. Give me your black sky. Give me your green eyes. Come on give me your white skin. Come on give me your white skin. Come on give me your white skin. I was out on the radio starting to change. Somewhere out in america. It's starting to rain. Could you tell me one thing you remember about me. And have you seen me lately?"

Sonny won't you come back come back. come back to me please.. Someday we'll hide the pain away and. Sonny I know that ... that we can laugh again.. I should have known and had more sense. sinking to a childish pride.. All I got was your looking glass. without your heart in side.

She hides like you. denies like you. sighs like you. but she ain't you.. Sonny. Sonny. Sonny won't you come back. come back to me.. Sonny. Sonny. Sonny oh. Oh.
4480,The other day I met someone I had known in another lifetime. Oh puzzle pieces lost without a trace fell into place in my mind. But we both knew what we were getting into. And we didn't want to stop. No we wouldn't want to miss it. Cause it seems like old times. So like long ago that I hardly even know. Who's who anymore. What's new anymore. So like long ago that it seems like old times. Familiar music man singing me a song from another lifetime. And urgent letters waiting for the post were uppermost in my mind. But he got through and then before we knew it. We didn't want to stop. No we wouldn't want to miss it. Didn't want to stop. No we wouldn't want to miss it. Cause it seems like old times. So like long ago that I hardly even know. Who's who anymore. What's new anymore. So like long ago that it seems like old times. When you reappeared and the moment I had always feared. Is upon me I felt slightly weird that's for sure. Now life is good to me though I don't see who I used to see. No it's not quite what it used to be anymore. The other day I met someone I had known in another lifetime. Oh puzzle pieces lost without a trace fell into place in my mind. But we both knew what we were getting into. And we didn't want to stop.

4481,This life's electric. You can feel the pulse out on the street. The boys keep moving. Girls they always seem to follow the beat. This town it breathes in. A hunger deeper down it's underground. These Changes they change. Familiar faces at one time look strange. Call me crazy cause i still hold on. Call me foolish i'm believer. we were never meant to walk alone. i don't think i'm the last of the dreamers. City's electric tonight. Burning under bright lights. The city's so active alive. Can you feel it?. You know we're living out loud like we still need it. we still need it. City electric. The city's electric tonight. The search is still on. Voices calling out from wilderness. Some say to let go. Some things are out of your control. I tried but i can't stop. Tried but i can't stop til we progress. Til we progress. Call me crazy but there's still a change. Call me foolish an overachiever. We can be exactly who we want. I don't think i'm the last of the dreamers. City's electric tonight. Burning under bright lights. The city's so active alive. Can you feel it?. You know we're living out loud like we still need it. we still need it. City electric. The city's electric tonight. Live like you feel it. Live like you need it.

4482,I'd like to understand just why. I feel like I have been through hell. BUT you tell me I haven't even started yet. To live here you've got to give more than you get. That I know. But they said it's all right. I'd like to understand today. Then maybe I would know who I was. When I was when it was yesterday. The seasons and the REASONS are on display. And I know. Oh... Oh........... Oh............ Bridge 1. So many people. They just seem to clutter up my mind. And if it's mine throw it away. Throw it again once for my girl...friend. Bridge 2. So many voices. Don't let them stop between my ears. But it appears that there they are. Though they are wrong ten thousand strong oh yeah. Bridge 3:. I'm lockin' my heart in the closet. I don't need anyone oh no no no. You find me behind the door. And all of the far-out faces. From long ago I can't erase this.
4484,Being hurt by the one you love. It's a feeling that's hard to hide. But you don't seem to understand why. When I'm alone I sit and cry. Ask any girl who's often left alone all by herself. Neglectfully pushed aside set aside like a doll on a shelf. Just ask any girl ooh and you'll understand why. I sit and cry. Ask any girl who knows the fear of losing someone dear. And she'll say the same thing it hurts you deep makes it hard to sleep. Don't take my word ask any girl then you'll understand why. I sit and cry. (La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la). Ask any girl who receives no loving affection. And she'll feel as I feel it's heartaches by the number. Many nights without slumber. Ask any girl ooh and then you'll know why. I sit and cry. I sit and cry.
4485,he dialed him about 6:00 pm. She checked her hair in the mirror. And she stepped through the door like this. Three flights down. And she's out on the streets. Walking brick sidewalks lined in grey concrete. He saw her coming from a few blocks away. Red scarf in the wind as it started to rain a bit. Shuffled down the boulevard. Cut me like a deck of cards. I thought you had me. You thought that you had me. But hey Devil go on. Get your junk out of here. I don't need you. I don't need you. Hey Devil go on. Get your junk out of here. I don't need you. So move on. I stepped to it like I knew what I was doing. I'm a moth. You're the flame. Never knew you'd be my ruin. In the blink of an eye. Element of surprise. Got my feet on the earth. But my face to the sky. Shuffled down the boulevard. Cut me like a deck of cards. I thought you had me. You thought you had me. Now the plot is thickening. Pushing deep under my skin. I thought you had me. You that that you had me. You're a beauty and A beast. You're the pressure never cease. You're the straight other side. And they say you never sleep. by: Cida Koizumi
4486,London's burning! London's burning!. All across the town all across the night. Everybody's driving with full headlights. Black or white turn it on fave the new religion. Everybody's sitting 'round watching television!. London's burning with boredom now. London's burning dial 99999. I'm up and down the Westway in an' out the lights. What a great traffic system - it's so bright. I can't think of better way to spend the night. Then speeding around underneath the yellow lights. London's burning with boredom now. London's burning dial 99999. Now in the subway and I'm looking for the flat. This one leads to this block this one leads to that. The wind howls through the empty blocks looking for a home. I run through the empty stone because I'm all alone. London's burning with boredom now.... London's burning dial 99999.

4489,Drunk all the whiskey. But I still canâ€™t get no rest. Brain trapped on a roller coaster. Got a pain in my chest. Cold water on my eyeballs. Send a shiver up my spine. Hit the street in the wee wee hours. This is the night hunting time. . CHORUS:. Donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing here. Donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing here. Got to get my senses clear. . Stumble in off the footpath. Heard the sounds from below. Get accustomed to the darkness. Got to take it real slow. Sweat streaminâ€™ down my cheekbones. Smoke stinginâ€™ my eyes. Walls drippinâ€™ like the jungle. But this ainâ€™t no paradise. . CHORUS. . Stumble up to the counter. Catch the tension in the air. Black Sabbath drive a young boy crazy. This ainâ€™t no frivolous affair. Young girl sipping Pernod. Budy hunger in her glance. No stoppinâ€™ when it comes to doinâ€™. The Heavy Metal Romance

4491,Welcome to where time stands still. No one leaves and no one will. Moon is full never seems to change. Just labeled mentally deranged. Dream the same thing every night. I see our freedom in my sight. No locked doors no windows barred. No things to make my brain seem scarred. Sleep my friend and you will see. That dream is my reality. They keep me locked up in this cage. Can't they see it's why my brain says rage. Sanitarium leave me be. Sanitarium just leave me alone. Build my fear of what's out there. And cannot breathe the open air. Whisper things into my brain. Assuring me that I'm insane. They think our heads are in their hands. But violent use brings violent plans. Keep him tied it makes him well. He's getting better can't you tell?. No more can they keep us in. Listen damn it we will win. They see it right they see it well. But they think this saves us from our hell. Sanitarium leave me be. Sanitarium just leave me alone. Sanitarium just leave me alone. Fear of living on. Natives getting restless now. Mutiny in the air. Got some death to do. Mirror stares back hard. Kill it's such a friendly word. Seems the only way. For reaching out again
4492,Billy on his way to school. Didn't care too much about the teachers and rules. But he had a plan he said he'd try it one day. One he knew would leave them all with nothing to say. He had a friend who said he'd teach him how to rock and roll. After school when he was feelin' good. he'd go home and do the things that he understood. He would rock in the kitchen and roll in the hall. And Billy's mother said you got no sense at all. But we know too well that he was. Learning how to rock and roll. 'Cos he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall. Stand on the tv and climb up the wall. Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor. Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more. And that's the only way to do it. When you're learning how to rock and roll. Teach me to rock.... Willy turns to the mirror and gives his hair a flip. He would mime to Elvis and curl his lip. Ha ha in the kitchen. Ha ha in the hall. Willy's mother said you got no sense at all. But we know too well that he was. Learning how to rock and roll. 'Cos he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall. Stand on the tv and climb up the wall. Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor. Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more. And that's the only way to do it. When you're learning how to rock and roll. Teach me to rock.... He learnt to rock and roll. And sing the blues. He learnt to head shake. While singing blue suede shoes. He learnt a hand clap. Off the beat. And at the gig he had them out of their seats. It's the only way to do it so long live rock and roll. 'Cos he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall. Stand on the tv and climb up the wall. Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor. Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more. And that's the only way to do it. When you're learning how to rock and roll. Teach me to rock...
4493,Written in these walls are the stories. That I can't explain. I leave my heart open. But it stays right here empty for days. She told me in the morning. She don't feel the same about us in her bones. It seems to me that when I die. These words will be written on my stone. And I'll be gone gone tonight. The ground beneath my feet is open wide. The way that I've been holdin' on too tight. With nothing in between. The story of my life I take her home. I drive all night to keep her warm and time. Is frozen (the story of the story of). The story of my life I give her hope. I spend her love. Until she's broke inside. The story of my life (the story of the story of). I tried carrying the weight of the world. But I only have two hands. I hope I get the chance to travel the world. But I don't have any plans. I wish that I could stay forever this young. Not afraid to close my eyes. Life's a game made for everyone. And love is the prize. So wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself. And I didn't know I was lost. So wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself. And I didn't know I was lost. And I've been waiting for this time to come around. But baby running after you. Is like chasing the clouds. So wake me up when it's all over (The story of my life I take her home). When I'm wiser and I'm older (I drive all night to keep her warm and time). All this time I was finding myself (Is frozen). And I didn't know I was lost. So wake me up when it's all over (The story of my life I give her hope). When I'm wiser and I'm older (I spend her love). All this time I was finding myself (Until she's broke inside).

4495,I can't use what I can't abuse. And I can't stop when it comes to you. You burned me out but I'm back at your door. Like Joan of Arc coming back for more. I nearly died. I nearly died. I nearly died. I came to cut you up. I came to knock you down. I came around to tear your little world apart. I came to shut you up. I came to drag you down. I came around to tear your little world apart. And break your soul apart. Ah you burn and burn to get under my skin. You burn too far now I won't give in. You crucified me but I'm back in your bed. Like Jesus Christ coming back from the dead. I nearly died. I nearly died. I nearly died. I came to knock you up. I came to cut you down. I came around to tear your little world apart. I came to rip you up. I came to shut you down. I came around to tear your little world apart. And break your soul apart. I nearly died. I nearly died. I nearly died. I came to cut you up. I came to knock you down. I came around to tear your little world apart. I came to shut you up. I came to suck you down. I came around to tear your little world apart. Tear your little world apart. Tear your little world apart. And break your soul apart. I can't stop when it comes to you. I can't stop when it comes to you. When it comes to you. When it comes to you
4497,what can I say. baby. what can I do. I tried and failed just to fit in. I greased the wheels. that only. drove away. always ends up the same.

4499,Picking up scales and broken chords. Puppy dog tails in the House of Lords. Tell me darling. What can it mean?. Making up moons in a minor key. What have those tunes got to do with me?. Tell me darling. Where have you been?. Once upon a long ago. Children searched for treasure. Nature's plan went hand in hand. With pleasure. Such pleasure.. Blowing balloons on a windy day. Desolate dunes with a lot to say. Tell me darling. What have you seen?. Once upon a long ago. Children searched for treasure. Nature's plan went hand in hand. With pleasure. My pleasure.. Playing guitars on an empty stage. Counting the bars of an iron cage. Tell me darling. What can it mean?. Picking up scales and broken chords. Puppy dog tails in the House of Lords. Help me darling. What does it mean?. Once upon a long ago....
4501,Words and music by John Deacon. Don't you misfire fill me up. With the desire to carry on. Don't you know honey that love's a game. It's always a hit or miss. So take your aim. Got to hold on tight. Shoot me out of sight. Don't you misfire fill me up. With the desire to carry on. Don't you misfire fill me up. With the desire to carry on. Your gun is loaded. And pointing my way. There's only one bullet. So don't delay. Got to time it right. Fire me through the night. Come on take a shot. Fire me higher. Don't you miss this time. Please don't misfire. Misfire
4502,A waking world of innocence. So grave those first born cries. When life begins with needles and pins. It ends with Swords and Knives. Oh dangerman oh dangerman. Your blade fits like a glove. When forged in steel. Time cannot heal. That blood red bond of love. In times of trouble you're an open book. With the change in the way you look. And its sad love's not enough to make things better. Turn the tables we'll burn the fables. Lies beneath the visions and daydreams. Fooled by now we mystify the past. Like a dream like it never happened. When life begins with needles and pins. It ends with Swords and Knives. God save those born to die
4505,I know in your eyes in the morning sun. I feel you touch me in the pouring rain. and the moment that you wander far from me. I wanna feel you in my arms again..

I really need to learn. Cause we're living in a world of fools. Breaking us down. When they all should let us be. We belong to you and me.. I believe in you. you know the door to my very soul.. You?re the light in my deepest darkest hour. You're my saviour when I fall.. And you may not think that I care for you. When you know down inside that I really do. And it's me you need to show. How deep is your love?. (Chorus). Is your love how deep is your love?. I really need to learn. Cause we're living in a world of fools. Breaking us down. When they all should let us be. We belong to you and me.. And you come to me on a summer breeze. keep me warm in your love then you softly leave. and it's me you need to show. how deep is your love. (Chorus). Is your love how deep is your love?. I really need to learn. Cause we're living in a world of fools. breaking us down. when they all should let us be. we belong to you and me.

4508,Fallen leaves like a blanket at my feet. There's a canopy of stars and I just miss you like crazy. Suddenly the world's too big. And the hours move too slow. And I just wish that you were holding me near. Seven days - it feels like a year. You whisper through the line. You know I miss you like crazy. So baby can you steal a plane. A boat the fastest train. You know it just don't feel the same when you're gone. (Chorus). 'Cause everytime you go away. The sunshine starts to fade. Frozen by the hands of time into a Permanent Monday. Take me back into your arms. And don't ever let me go. 'Cause when I see you walk through that door. I'm not lost anymore. I'm home. I'm home. I won't sleep until you're finally next to me. Can't wait to breathe you in. Don't wanna waste my time dreamin'. I just wanna treat your name like a whisper on my skin. And never have to say goodbye again. [CHORUS:]. 'Cause everytime you go away. The sunshine starts to fade. Frozen by the hands of time into a Permanent Monday. Take me back into your arms. And don't ever let me go. 'Cause when I see you walk through that door. I'm not lost anymore. I'm home. 'Cause when I feel you right here close to me. Everything is where it's supposed to be.

And it's you and I my friend (you and I my friend). You and I now friend. Here our memory lay corrupted and our city lay dry. Let me make this vow to you. Here where it's blood for blood and an eye for an eye. Let me show you what love can do. Let me show you what love can do. Here we bear the mark of Cain. We'll let the light shine through. Let me show you what love can do. Let me show you what love can do. Let me show you what love can do. Let me show you what love can do

4564,I was folding up your letters. Unpacking winter clothes. Searching for my hat. I thought I left it by the door. So I tore around the room. Like a bird without a head. I saw your picture waving back at me. From underneath the bed. From a long long time ago. When all I had. Was a hat full of stars. The one I'll always treasure. The one that you wore. You loved the look. But you never looked inside. You would have seen us there. You could've seen far. You should've seen the magic. In my hat full of stars. I'm trying to live in the present. But I keep tripping on the past. Finding out reality well clarity. Comes in dribs and drabs. No we never had the time. For everything we had. So it felt like we had nothing. That's what makes this hat so sad. It was a long long time ago. When all we had. Was a hat full of stars.... ...You would have seen us there. You could've seen far. You should've seen the magic. In my hat full of stars. Now whenever I'm alone. And I think I might forget. I wear my lucky hat. Just like a crown up on my head -. 'Cause all I have. Is a hat full of stars.... If you could see me now. You would've seen far. You should've seen the magic. In my hat full of stars....

4566,Natives wearing turquoise and silver. Dirty dogs barking in the distance. Ooooh people of a thousand tongues. I'm learning the primitive rights. I'm doing as the Romans do. Mt. Kalais to Mt. Everest. Then down to the River Ganges. Ooooh to follow your mighty past. We're learning the primitive rights. We're doing as the Romans do. Old world new world. I know nothing. But I'll keep dancing. City's crumble into the ocean. City's getting built in the sky. Ooooh now we're talking digital. We're learning the primitive rights. We're doing as the Romans do.

4567,There's more that rises in the morning than the sun. And more that shines in the night than just the moon. There's more than just this fire here that keeps me warm. In a shelter that is larger than this room. And there's a loyalty that's deeper than mere sentiments. And a music higher than the songs that I can sing. Stuff of Earth competes for the allegiance. I owe only to the Giver of all good things. So if I stand let me stand on the promise that you will pull me through. And if I can't let me fall on the grace that first brought me to you. So if I sing let me sing for the joy that has born in me these songs. And if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for his home. And there's more that dances on the prairies than the wind. And more that pulses in the ocean than the tide. There's a love that's fiercer than the love between friends. More gentle than a mother's when her baby's at her side. And there's a loyalty that's deeper than mere sentiments. And a music higher than the songs that I can sing. The stuff of Earth competes for the allegence. I owe only to the Giver of all good things. So if I stand let me stand on the promise that You will pull me through. And if I can't let me fall on the grace that first brought me to You. And if I sing let me sing for the joy that has born in me these songs. And if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for his home. So if I stand let me stand on the promise You will pull me through. And if I can't let me fall on the grace that first brought me to You. And if I sing let me sing for the joy that has born in me these songs. And if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for his home.
4569,If you think you're hearing something. And you can't think what it is. If you feel a quiet longing. Lift your heart into the wind. There you'll find my kindred spirit. There you'll meet me as a friend. It is just a kindred feeling. And a song to let you in....

4574,I do my best to hide this low down feeling. I try to make believe there's nothing wrong. Oh but they're always asking me about you darling. And it hurts me so to tell them that you're gone. If they ask me I guess I'd be denying. That I've been unhappy all along. Oh but if they heard my heart they'd hear it crying. Oh where's my darling when's she coming home?. Well I've asked myself a million times what's right for me to do?. To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you. Well I make it pretty good until that moon comes shining through. And then I get so doggone lonesome. Well time stands still when you're a-waiting. Sometimes I think my heart is stopping too. You know one lonely hour seems forever. Just sixty minutes more to wait for you. Oh but I guess I'll keep waiting 'til you're with me. 'Cause I believe that loving you is right. Well I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow. If I can't have you with me tonight. Well I know I'll keep on loving you. Because true love can't be killed. I know I ought to get you off my mind but I guess I never will. I could have a dozen others but I know I'd love you still. 'Cause I get so doggone lonesome. Oh I get so doggone lonesome. Oh I get so doggone lonesome

4592,Hey little girl. Did you see through your window?. Something strange in the woods. And you see a light so far. Strange sounds moving. Through the deep dark night. Trying to call your name. Then you see and scream loud so loud. Can you see a light moving through the trees?. Trying to say to you to come back from dust. It's too late to runaway babe. When Satan orders we'll rise to say. (refrain). Tonight we ride. Tonight we'll kill'it all. And to Hell - the Devil will possess your soul. Walking through the forest. Dark shadows rise from thumbs. Dirt and blood is their eyes. Loud whispers bringing death from the sky. Strange sounds coming. Through the deep dark hell. Now crawling in your skin. Then you feel and brings that hate to life. Can you feel the death moving through the breeze?. Trying to say to you to come back from dusk. It's too late to runaway babe. When Satan orders we'll rise to say. (refrain). Lay down to your guiding ghost. Now you're under their control. Lay down to the blackened hole. Now you're lost without a soul
4595,In the beginning. Back in nineteen fifty five. Man didn't know 'bout a rock 'n' roll show. 'n all that jive. The white man had the schmaltz. The black man had the blues. No one knew what they was gonna do. But tchaikovsky had the news. He said. Let there be sound and there was sound. Let there be light and there was light. Let there be drums there was drums. Let there be guitar there was guitar ah. Let there be rock. And it came to pass. That rock 'n' roll was born. All across the land every rockin' band. Was blowin' up a storm. And the guitar man got famous. The business man got rich. And in every bar there was a superstar. With a seven year itch. There was fifteen million fingers. Learnin' how to play. And you could hear the fingers pickin'. And this is what they had to say. Let there be light. sound. drums. 'n guitar ah. Let there be rock. One night in a club called the shakin' hand. There was a 42 decibel rockin' band. And the music was good. And the music was loud. And the singer turned and he said to the crowd. Let there be rock
4596,Towards the light. I will move on. And so i learn. To move the one. Before the next. Steps i take. Will pave. The road. Ahead of me. I woke this morning. Wondering if i was alive. My head was spinning in circles. Turning to the other side. Apparent broken i hold on to walk. I stumbled over my body. I stumbled over my words. On control upon all wasted. As if i were beyond belief. Apparent broken i hold on to walk. Towards the light [but im afraid]. I will walk [behind the gate]. I will walk [to ride the rain]. Towards the light. I will walk [behind the frame]. I will walk [put up the gate]. Toward the light. Faster than. The speed of mind. Both my arms. Are wrapped around. This new experience. My head in clouds. My feet firmly on the ground. Towards the light. I will walk. I wrapped my arms. Around the ground. Beneath my feet. Towards the light. I will run. I will run. I will run. towards the light. Towards the light. I will move on. And so i learn. To move the one. Before the next. Steps i take. Will pave. The road. Ahead of me. . (fonte: site oficial)

4604,I've been on the road too long. Moving in the wrong direction. I don't know where I belong. I don't know what I will do if I can't get back home. Troubles I've got on my rope. They don't fit no other person. Memories keep rollin' on. I don't know what I will do if I can't get back home. I don't fit but I don't give a damn. I won't quit cause I know who I am. And I admit and I've been on the left. Bit by bit I'll review my plan. This is it do the best I can. Trust and understand. 'Cause that I know I'm loved. I'll be on my way. Got no need to stay 'round here. 'Cause I been on this road too long. Going in the wrong direction. And I don't know where I come from. All I know is I will die if I don't get back home
4605,(Ian McLagan Ronnie Lane). My mom she likes you. She thinks your swell. Got the makings of a dance hall girl. Your lowcut frock and your birds nest hair. Stepping up heels and the way that you smell. She says to take you back. To see my folks again. On Sunday. Why it looks as though theres nobody in. They've all went out to see my Auntie Renny. Don't you worry you just come right in. I'm sure we'll pass the time til they come home. Well let me take your coat. Take off your shoes warm your toes. Try the sofa. Its getting dark we'll miss the late night bus. It's only eight but I'm not taking any chances. Whats that noise why'd they come back so soon. Straighten your dress you're really looking a mess.

4608,The summer sun has got me crazy. Playing tricks with my poor mind. You said you had another man. And I said I guess I didn't mind. What's he got that I ain't got. Besides stability. Can he drive all night and never stop. Well I guess you'll have to wait and see. (Chorus). I heard a voice call to me. Saying someday you're gonna be free. . Put a dollar in the jukebox. But don't you play our favorite tune. 'Cause seeing you dance to that. Is only gonna bring me to ruin. Someday sunny sounds will soothe me. But it won't happen soon. 'Cause the cloud you left hanging over. Is raining like a mean monsoon. (Chorus repeat)
4610,The sands of time. Like shattering glass go past her. Like a tunnel. Goes to the sea. No one heard her call his name. No one heard the sound she made. They wouldn? t have liked it much anyway. To know that she still loves him. No one understands this love. No one ever will. Till his dying day. He was heard to say. She loves him still. I miss my friend. I miss the sound of his laughter. She remembers him saying. Well where are you going. Oh and just what is it that you are after. No one understands this man. No one ever will. Till his dying day. Not even he himself can change this. She loves him still. So how are you. Have you learned to deal with this. No I have not learned. She says I cannot deal without him?. But you know the flame still burns. The flame still burns. No one understands this man. No one ever will. Till his dying day. Not even he himself can change this. She loves him still. Oh baby. She loves him still. Always. And the sands of time.

I need the love my dear. I miss so much. My world is empty without you baby. My world is empty without you baby. From this old world. I try to hide my face. But from this loneliness.

He didn't scream. Maybe he's just built that way. Ohh Ohh. Eh eh eh eh. Look try and ascertain this. Swim around in circles do the same shit. Welcome to my circus to my slaveship. I'm a servant to the devil to my payslip. Everybody's telling me to smile more. Preaching politics fuck 'em I'll be Guy Fawkes. Racking up the haters man I need 'em give me five more. At least I know I'm winning I'm on fine form. See I don't give a fuck if they don't like me. I'm a motherfucking King and they should knight me. You don't like my fuckin' arrogance fight me. I'll knock your head off your neck before my flight leaves. Where am I going to?. Places rolling into one. I'm an Orca encapsulated I'm Tilikum. I need to skill up and chill out and put J Dilla on. I'm close to breaking and killing now that my kin is gone. They're all gone. It's just me. They're all gone. It's just me. And all these leeches on my dick. All these preachers on my back. Can't you see that I am sick?. Can't you see why I could snap?. Look I'm amazing at my job that is gospel that's a fact. But there's some people skills I obviously lack. I'm a wild killer push me bro I'm warning ya. You're gonna wish you never touched me when I'm flooring ya. I'll sink my jaws into your neck and ring the coroner.

4620,It's coming down outside another lonely night. You said you were just going out with your friends. I'm waiting up this time I hope you didn't lie. Never used to be like this way back then. I never know where you're at. Another train out of the tracks. And now I don't wanna live like that. No woohhh. When you walked in so damn late. What the hell was I supposed to think?. When you felt too much to take. And you really looked guilty oh. When you wouldn't even look at me. There's only one thing it could be. You were with him all this time. So that's one last kiss goodbye. No more alone nights no more little lies. You've broken my trust and it can't be fixed. I should've seen the signs should've recognized. The way your lips looked like they've been kissed. How did we end up like that?. Another train out of the tracks. And always hurts looking back. No woohhh. When you walked in so damn late. What the hell was I supposed to think?. When you felt too much to take. And you really looked guilty oh. When you wouldn't even look at me. There's only one thing it could be. You were with him all this time. So that's one last kiss goodbye. Another lesson lived in life woohhh. And I can't ask the missing of why
4621,I can't free myself of the suspicion. For your motives on your mission. Some people live for the rules I live for exceptions. Can't take part in the deception. But I know just how it feels to wanna blow the world away. Just to get to what is real it won't work cuz. Everybody grinds to a hlat now and then. Everybody's game gets salt then again. No matter what the papers say they're normal as they come. Bodyguards ball of wax they hide behind the gun. They get a panic pulse when they are so far from home. To me that is the reason to continue to roam. Exhilaration mix with the people skunk blazing. Checking out the shows that are sadly unamazing. Chorus:. Hostile Apostle who you following. Negative energy that you're swallowing. Some coked out mal-content who's soul is up for rent. Victim of lost soul Hostile Apostle. Unlimited in time and space and nearest universal. Light is what we're reachin for it's not rehearsal. Follow this around follow this hustle. Makin use of everything movin all your muscle. Angry human leads impressionable boy. To skulls and piercings I will destroy. All of your heroes speak nothing to me. One emotion one tempo and no real feeling. In this field we are the presence of the thoughts you're missin. Keepin positive's intact from all the people dissin. Open your eyes look at who you're kissin. If you can't hear it people just listen. (Chorus). Angry human leads impressionable boy. To skulls and piercings I will destroy. All of your heroes speak nothing to me. You don't have to be a prick just to be heavy. Changin all the time we changin all the same. Change in this life and this eternal frame. Warm in the sun refresh in the breeze. Glow in the stars blossom in the trees. Livin through life in infinite extent. Spread undivided operate unspent. No high no low no great and no small. Build and bound connect and equal all.
4622,Good evening Mr.Waldheim. and Pontiff how are you?. you have so much in common. in the things you do.

And Jesse you're inside my thoughts. as the rhythmic words subside. my Common Ground invites you in. or do you prefer to wait outside. Or is it true. the Common Ground for me is without you. Or is it true. the Common Ground for me is without you. Oh is it true. there's no Ground Common enough for me and you.

4666,Black eyed ravens. They spiral down. They tilt his head back. To the flame filled sunset. Raise their guns high. As the darken falls. These are the days boys. Shallow man. Shallow man (shallow man) and they. Eats in the doorways with his head inclined. And he's always in decline. No-one hears anymore. So he shrinks as they ride. Under vermillion skies. So it goes (so it goes). Just a searcher (so it goes). Lonely soul (so it goes). The last of the dreamers (so it goes). Shallow man. Shallow man. Speaks to the shadows. Moves his trembling hands. And he's always a little late. For the dawning of the day. So it goes (so it goes). Just a searcher (so it goes). Lonely soul (so it goes). The last of the dreamers (so it goes). (so it goes) Just a searcher. (so it goes) Lonely soul. (so it goes) The last of the dreamers (so it goes). (so it goes) Just a searcher. (so it goes) Lonely soul. (so it goes) The last of the dreamers (so it goes). (so it goes). (so it goes). (so it goes).
4667,As a child I play in the sandbox.. As a child we could be friends.. Now that we have grown older. That's come to a bitter end.. Trucks and horses replaced by guns.. Ethnic hatred replaces the fun.. We go on fighting and murdering brothers.. But the greatest gift is love.. Chorus: An eye for an eye. a tooth for a tooth or a cup of tea for two.. An eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth. or a cup of tea for two.. So again we relive the story.. The same old story man after man.. And we think we're just so wise.. Then why can't we get back to the sand.. Chorus: And we search for more. never finding much.. Believe like a child believes in love.. Chorus (2x)..
4669,When I was a young boy. My mama said to me. Your daddy's leavin' home today. I think he's gone to stay.. We packed up all our bags. And drove out to Winnipeg.. When we got to Winnipeg. I checked in to school.. I wore white bucks on my feet. When I learned the golden rule.. The punches came fast and hard. Lying on my back in the school yard.. Don't be denied don't be denied.. Don't be denied don't be denied.. Don't be denied don't be denied.. Well pretty soon I met a friend. He played guitar.. We used to sit on the steps at school. And dream of being stars.. We started a band. We played all night.. Don't be denied don't be denied.. Don't be denied don't be denied.. Don't be denied don't be denied.. Oh Canada. We played all night. I really hate to leave you now. But to stay just wouldn't be right.. Down in Hollywood. We played so good. The businessmen crowded around. They came to hear the golden sound. There we were on the Sunset Strip. Playing our songs for the highest bid.. We played all night. The price was right.. Don't be denied don't be denied.. Don't be denied don't be denied.. Don't be denied don't be denied.. Well all that glitters isn't gold. I know you've heard that story told.. And I'm a pauper in a naked disguise. A millionaire through a business man's eyes.. Oh friend of mine. Don't be denied.. .

Livin' for the part. Givin' from the heart. Now and forever. But if we let it wait too long. What we have is gone. Memory only. This could be heaven. Maybe we could start a life today. This could be heaven. Love instead of throwin' it all away. This could be heaven. You and me we know we're our best friends. This could be heaven. Whoever thought we would get this far. Tryin' for all these years. The thought that we would fade away. Was more than I could bear. Oh I would do anything if you would stay. If you'd stay. Say. We should be right here. Get through all this fear. One of these days. One of these days. This could be heaven. Turnin' it on for human kind. With you by my side. This could be heaven. Sure we could decide to run away.

Isn't it strange how we all feel a little bit weird. sometimes. Isn't it hard. Standing in the rain.. You're on the verge of going crazy and your heart's in pain.

Waiting for a sign.. Hoping that my luck will change.. Reaching for a hand that can understand. Someone who feels the same.. When you live in a cookie cutter world. Being different is a sin.. So you don't stand out.. And you don't fit in. Weird.. Sitting on the side. Waiting for a sign.. Hoping that my luck will change.. Reaching for a hand that can understand. Someone who feels the same.. When you live in a cookie cutter world. If you're different you can't win.. So you don't stand out. And you don't fit in. Weird.. Isn't it strange how we all feel a little bit weird. Strange how we all get a little bit.. Strange 'cause we're all just a little bit weird sometimes.

4705,My life it feels just like a never-ending Monday morning. Somebody wake me from this nightmare. Will it ever end?. No I don't like it. No color in the sky the same old tired situation. Stuck in the place I can't escape. I've been here way too long. All this monotony has gotten me nowhere. But doubt I'm reckless and on fire. I still remember. We did whatever. We had it all when we were young and free. Was never better those were the best of times. One last thrill and always. It seemed to feel so right. What I'd give for one taste. Of one last thrill before I die. I go to work the boss is clamoring for my attention. Another monologue I've heard a million times before. No I'm not lying. I'm bored to death as I can beg it since I dont remember. It's like a promise like a suicide I can't endure. Whenever I don't get any time I think I'm gonna die. I'm reckless and on fire. I still remember. I did whatever. I had it all when I was young and free. Was never better those were the best of times. One last thrill and always. It seemed to feel so right. What I'd give for one taste. Of one last thrill before I die. I wanna feel what I felt before. I wanna know there's something more. 'Cause the Devil down in me it never dies. I wanna revel in ecstasy. I want that drug down on me. Wanna live just like I'm dying. I don't wanna let this moment pass me by. I wave bye bye bye. (solo). One last thrill and always. It seemed to feel so right. What I'd give for one taste. Of one last thrill before I.... One last thrill and always. It seemed to feel so right. What I'd give for one taste. Of one last thrill before I die

4709,"The wine beneath the bed. The things we've done and said. And all the memories that come glancing back to me. In my loneliness. You're standing in the breach. Beyond that stretch but our love will reach. Unconsciousness that find me sometimes wondering. Where you're at.. Hmm take me back again. Take me back one more time Spanish rose.. The way you pulled the gate. Behind you when you said ""It ain't too late. Come on let's have a ball. And swing the town tonight."". And hoping you'd come through. And many others too. And all the friends we used to have in days gone by. I'm wondering. If you'll take me back again. Take me back one more time Spanish rose.. And when the lights went out. And no one was abandoning the country in full bloom. In the room we danced. And many hearts were torn. And when the word went around that everything was wrong. And couldn't be put right. It tore me up it tore me up.. In slumber you did sleep. The window I did creep. And touch your raven hair and sing that song. Again to you.. You did not even wince. You thought I was the Prince. To come and take you from your misery. And lonely castle walls.. Ah take me back again. Take me back one more time Spanish rose.. (fadeout). Ah ah ah ah. Mmmj mmm. Da da da di da da da ...."

Five hundred miles I have gone today. Tomorrow it's five hundred more. Outside my window the world passes by. It's stranger than a dream. Just like fire would I burn up. Just like fire would. Just like fire would I burn up. I go to work and I earn my pay load. My sweat it falls to the ground. I see you now but we may never meet again child. The ice is hanging on the door. One night in a motel room. Eyes cast like steel. I drank the wine they had left on my table. I knew the morning was too far. Just like fire would I burn up. Just like fire would. Just like fire would I burn up

4726,I looked upon the book of life. Tracing the lines of face after face. Looking down at their naked feet. Bound in chains bound in chains. Chains of leather chains of gold. We knew it was wrong but we looked away. And paraded them down the colonial streets. And that's how they became enslaved. They came across on the great ships. Mothers separated from their babes. Husbands stood on the auction block. Bound in chains bound in chains. Chains of leather chains of gold. Men knew it was wrong but they looked away. And led them to toil in fields of white. As they turned their necks to a bitter landscape. Oh the people I hear them calling. Am I not a man and a brother. Am I not a woman and a sister. History sends us such strange messengers. They come down through time. To embrace to enrage. And in their arms even stranger fruit. And they swing from the trees. With their vision in flames. Ropes of leather ropes of gold. Men knew it was wrong but they looked away. Messengers swinging from twisted rope. As they turned their necks to a bitter landscape. Oh the people I hear them calling. Am I not a man and a brother. Am I not a woman and a siste. r We will be heard we will be heard
4728,Chorus:. You know that you'll never find. A love as true as mine. Our love is a one of a kind. Boy why waste your time. . Foul play never brought you down. You took your love on a rebound. Been no angles just straight ahead. 'Cause you know where my heart is. . Bridge. So don't turn me away. I know that we can make it. I beg you to stay. Give our love a try 'cause you know.... . Repeat Chorus. . You shake me up but you can't bring me down. This school girl crush you can't push around. So set your game on the right track. 'Cause once you leave it's hard to get back. . Repeat Bridge. Repeat Chorus. . You know it now show it you know it. It's a one of a kind love.
4731,I don't know but I've been told. The streets of hell are paved with gold. Crazy crazy. You told me that nothing's free. Except my own insanity. Crazy maybe. Wake me shake me. Wake me shake me. You offer me the world and all its wealth. All for myself. You promised me a life eternally. And drink to my health. I may seem only half-glued. But I can see right through you. Burn it up burn it down. Burn this sucker to the ground. Oh yeah oh yeah. Going going going gone. There's a party going on. And on and on and on. Do you think I don't know who you are. A fallen star. When I feel my soul scream out at night. I know you're not far. You need a better disguise. This one won't win any prize. Burn it up burn it down. Burn this sucker to the ground. Oh yeah oh yeah. Going going going gone. There's a party going on. And on and on and on. Cleansed by fire cleansed by fire. I may seem only half-glued. But I can see right through you. What about dark.

What about Christ. What about peace. What about love. What about faith in God above. What about war. What about hell. What if I stumble. What if I fell. What about blood. What about greed. And all of these things you're offering me. Yeah what about me little me. You lose and I win. You couldn't suck me in. It's over you have no power. You're lost And I'm found. And I'm Heaven bound. Go back to where you belong. To where you fell. Go to hell.

When all the chips are down. See I will always be around. Just to be right where you are. My love you know I love you. I will never leave you out. I will always let you in. To places no one's ever been. Deep inside can't you see. That I believe in you and me. Maybe I'm a fool. To feel the way I do. But I will play the fool forever. Just to be with you forever. I believe in miracles. And love's a miracle. Baby you're my dream come true. I was lost now I'm free. I believe in you and me. See I was lost now I'm free. 'Cause I believe in you and me.

It's too late too apologize. By the time this song is done. I'll be gone I'll be gone.. I should have listened when my friends said you were crazy. I should have shown a little spine and self respect. but I couldn't see the signs. Your so called love had made me blind. Tied me up and left me for dead. Don't beg me to reconsider. Don't bother getting on your knees. 'Cause there's absolutely nothing you can say. to change my mind. So save you breath...

Will someday just collide. I couldn't care cause I'm already there.. Just a boy who's young at heart. His smile was a bit like yours today. Had a wife a kid some strife. Never had to go astray. Happiness abounds. Life was in full swing. At seventeen all the things he wanted. Were things he'd never see. It don't seem fair cause I'm already there.

But too many opponents made you weary of the fight. Blinded by passion you foolishly let someone in. All the warnings went off in your head. Still you had to give in. Just when you think you got it down. Resistance nowhere to be found. They whisper Promises In The Dark. But promises you know what they're for. It sounds so convincing but you heard it before.

Just when you think you got it down. Your heart in pieces on the ground. They whisper Promises In The -- Dark.

4841,"Money stole my lady. Fools have a way of making me crazy. Money buy you freedom. Rules have a way of making me lazy. And so we grow a little older. With another tale to tell. So we grow a little colder. With another tale to tell. Money make you feel unhappy. Fools have a way of making me crazy. And so we grow a little older. With another tale to tell. So we grow a little colder. With another tale to tell. .... Feel like I'm flying I'm dying to say. \""Want you forever and easy\"". Be where you are where I want you to stay. Don't you know what I'm saying?. Believe me. Feel like I'm falling it's all I can do. Lyin' and dyin' is lonely. Deeper and darker no way to forgive. No way to believe what you told me. No way to believe what you told me. Way to believe. [guitar solo (Joey Molland)]. Kings in their castles wound up in the wine. Drinking their confidence daily. Wish I could be into that peace of mine. Wish I could be into crazy. Wish I could be into crazy. Wish I could be..."
4842,Blown Round By The Wind. Thrown Down In a Spin. I Gave You Love. I Thought That We Had Made It To The Top. I Gave You All I Had To Give. Why Did It Have To Stop. You've Blown It All Sky High. By Telling Me a Lie. Without a Reason Why. You've Blown It All Sky High. You You've Blown It All Sky High. Our Love Had Wings To Fly. We Could Have Touched The Sky. You've Blown It All Sky High. Up Round I've Flown. Then Down Down Like a Stone. I Gave You Love ....

4847,I've been the needle and the thread. Weaving figure eights and circles round your head. I try to laugh but cry instead. Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said. Fumbling through your dresser drawer. Forgot what I was looking for. Try to guide me in the right direction. Making use of all this time. Keeping everything inside. Close my eyes and listen to you cry. I'm lifting you up. I'm letting you down. I'm dancing til dawn. I'm fooling around. I'm not giving up. I'm making your love. This city's made us crazy and we must get out. This is not goodbye she said. It is just time for me to rest my head. She does not walk she runs instead. Down these jagged streets and into my bed. Fumbling through your dresser drawer. Forgot what I was looking for. Try to guide me in the right direction. Making use of all this time. Keeping everything inside. Close my eyes and listen to you cry. I'm lifting you up. I'm letting you down. I'm dancing til dawn. I'm fooling around. I'm not giving up. I'm making your love. This city's made us crazy and we must get out. There's only so much I can do for you. After all of the things you've put me through. I'm lifting you up. I'm letting you down. I'm dancing til dawn. I'm fooling around. I'm not giving up. I'm making your love. This city's made us crazy and we must get out

4850,[No Doubt:]. Take this pink ribbon off my eyes. I'm exposed. And it's no big surprise. Don't you think I know. Exactly where I stand. This world is forcing me. To hold your hand. 'Cause I'm just a girl little 'ol me. Don't let me out of your sight. I'm just a girl all pretty and petite. So don't let me have any rights. Oh... I've had it up to here!. [Pink:]. The moment that I step outside. So many reasons. For me to run and hide. I can't do the little things I hold so dear. 'Cause it's all the little things. That I fear. [No Doubt:]. 'Cause I'm just a girl I'd rather not be. 'Cause they won't let me drive. Late at night. [Pink:]. Oh I'm just a girl. Guess I'm some kind of freak. 'Cause they all sit and stare. With their eyes. [No Doubt:]. I'm just a girl. Take a good look at me. Just your typical prototype here we go!. Oh... I've had it up to here!. Oh... am I making myself clear?. Las Vegas am I making myself clear?. I'm just a girl. [Pink:]. I'm just a girl in the world. [Pink No Doubt]. That's all that you'll let me be!. [No Doubt:]. I'm just a girl living in captivity. Your rule of thumb. Makes me worry some.

4851,Thought I might get a rocket ride. When I was a child but it was a lie. That I told myself when I needed something good. At seventeen had a better dream.. Now I'm thirty-three and it isn't me. But I'd think of something better if I could. All my friends and lovers leave me behind. I'm still looking for a girl. One way or another. I'm just hoping to find a way. To put my feet out in the world. Caught some grief from a falling leaf. As she tumbled down to the dirty ground. Said I should have put her back there if I could. But everyone needs a better day. And I'm trying to find me a better way. To get from the things I do to the things I should. All my friends and lovers leave me alone. To try to have a little fun. One way or another I just wish I had known. To go out walking in the sun. And find out if you were the one. Does it make you wanna come a little closer now?. And did you wanna dance with me?. Did you wanna hum a little harder now?. Can you see her waiting there?. Can you see her? Because I'm almost there. Can you see her waiting there for someone like me?. All you want is a beauty queen. Not a superstar but everybody's dream machine. All you want is a place to lay your head. You go to sleep dreaming how you would. Be a different kind if you thought you could. But you come awake the way you are instead. All my friends and lovers shine like the sun. I just turn and walk away. One way or another. I'm not coming undone. I'm just waiting for the day.

4857,"Not a soul was stirrin'. Not a bird was singin'. Least not within my hearin'. I was five minutes past carin'. Standing in the road just starin'. Thought I heard somebody pleadin'. Thought I heard someone apologize. Some fell down weepin'. Others shook their fists up at the skies. And those who were left. Seemed to be wearing disguises. Now there's a queen in waitin'. Not enough lovin' and too much hatin'. Was the prince hidden within her man?. Always seems to be hesitatin'. He said ""Let her go let her go God bless her. She hasn't been gone long enough for me to miss her. Except every minute of every hour of every day. When I wish I could possess her"". 40 days passed by 40 alibis. So carry on that way. And in time you'll pay. But we'll all be together. Come Ascension Day. Not a hound was howlin'. Or whimperin' or prowlin'. Now the wind had departed. Not a leaf was hangin' on the tree. Like when it started. But I know they will return. Like they've never gone away. Come Ascension Day"

4861,(Sonny Boy Williamson). [produced by Mike Vernon A side of Decca F 11996 1964 first solo single]. Good morning little schoolgirl. Good morning little schoolgirl. Can I come home with. Can I come home with you. Tell your mama and your papa. I once was a schoolboy too. Sometimes I don't know what. Sometimes I don't know what. What in the world. What in the world to do. Oh I don't want to hurt your feelings. Or even get mad at you. At all. I'm gonna buy me an airplane. I'm gonna buy me an airplane. Fly right over. Fly right over town. If I don't find my baby. Ain't gonna put my airplane down. Good morning little schoolgirl. Good morning little schoolgirl. Can I come home with. Can I come home with you. Tell your mama and your papa.

4862,....the dice. . . Chasin' away. Feels like I'm. Chasing nowhere. Doing whatever I feel. I just keep falling down. You know in every way.
4864,There was another girl. She was much like you. She lived in the past. And had trouble with the future. Well she walked with her head held high. And her hands held down at the sides. . It was everything that I had not wanted. There were reasons to be crazy. . (Chorus). Make no mistake about it. (When she stopped crying her eyes got bright). Make no mistake about it. (She walked with her head held high and her hands held down at her. sides). Make no mistake about it. ( Make no mistake about it... those were real tears). Make no mistake about it. (Make no mistake about it... I've always been unreal)
4865,Obscure the late afternoon with a drape. Don't let him follow her latest escape. Or the fanfare of taxis that needlessly played. As a forty watt bulb burns a hole in the shade. Then they got into a passionate fight. Now she's lost in the shadows thrown over at twilight. At the Empire Hotel they first came face to face. Pieces would fall off all over the place. And there in the debris they'd laugh and recline. Tell me my dear are you more or less mine. Then they got into a passionate fight. She says now this isn't love it's what you do in spite of it. And I can't go on with it night after night after night. Camphor and cigarettes perfume the scandal. Now he's counting the hinges and watching the door handle. As he hangs the clothes on the back of the door. Perfectly matching outfits that she wore. Women come quietly and some remain with their pity. But others know the pain of the passion of fight. Though the chance they will win is impossibly slight. He cowers before them so invitingly. And in the long run they'll be chastised and hated. Or walk out frustrated or humiliated. That is the pointless delight of a passionate fight. This isn't love what you do in spite of it. I can't go on night after night after night after night after night after night...
4866,Single minded. Single minded. I see no right I see no wrong. Just what it takes to get along. A modern man since time began. And if you want to be with me. You can and you can still be free.

Give me a kiss and walk away. Single minded single minded. Single minded. Single minded. Single minded. Single minded
4870,Something about me didn't fit into your perfect world. I bet the bluegrass stained your smile. You should use a darker color when you write on the wall. I haven't read it a thousand times. Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize. Honey I was trying so hard. To talk walk think stop. Anytime you want me to. Bend all my rules. I used to let you choose. Who you wanted me to be. This time I'm flying free. It's my turn to be me. You liked the face but you had to replace me. Inside I saw the walls of me go down. You can take the girl away from. Cowboy hats and steel guitars.

4872,"Oh I used to be disgusted. and now I try to be amused.. But since their wings have got rusted. you know the angels wanna wear my red shoes.. But when they told me 'bout their side of the bargain. that's when I knew that I could not refuse.. And I won't get any older now the angels wanna wear my red shoes.. I was watching while you're dancing away.. Our love got fractured in the echo and sway.. How come everybody wants to be your friend?. You know that it still hurts me just to say it.. Oh I know that she's disgusted (oh why's that). Cause she's feeling so abused. (oh that's too bad). She gets tired of the lust (oh I'm so sad). but it's so hard to refuse.. How can you say that I'm too old. when the angels have stolen my red shoes.. Oh I said ""I'm so happy I could die."". She said ""Drop dead"" then left with another guy..

4873,Sail on silver wings. through this storm. what fortune love may bring. back to my arms again. the love of a former golden age.. I am disabled by fears concerning which course to take.. For now that wheels are turning. I find my faith deserting me.... This night is filledwith cries of. dispossessed children in search of Paradise.. A sign of unresolve that. envisioned drives the pinwheel on-and-on.. I am disabled by fears concerning which course to take.. When memory bears witness to. the innocence consumed in dying rage!. The way lies through our love;. there can be no other means to the end. or keys to my heart.... You will never find. You will never find!

4890,"Well they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late that month. Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none. He came home too drunk from mixin' Tanqueray and wine. He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call'm Johnny 99. Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop. Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top. When an off-duty cop snuck up on him from behind. Out in front of the Club Tip Top they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99. Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was Mean John Brown. He came into the courtroom and stared young Johnny down. Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime. Prison for 98 and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 99. A fist fight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away. His mama stood up and shouted ""Judge don't take my boy this way"". Well son you got a statement you'd like to make. Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away. Now judge I had debts no honest man could pay. The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they were gonna take my house away. Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man. But it was more `n all this that put that gun in my hand. Well your honor I do believe I'd be better off dead.

Oh what a letdown when the battle was finally won. One little breakdown and then it was over and done. I wish I had your confidence. It's love and not coincidence.

It's a strange way of saying that I know ""I'm supposed. to love you"". ""I'm supposed to love you"". Whoa-oh-oh. I've already given up on myself twice. Third time is the charm. Third time is the charm. Threw caution to the wind but I've got a lousy arm. And I've traced your shadows on the wall. Now I kiss them whenever I'm down whenever I'm down.

I'm not running I'm looking .... Did I tell you I've saved all your letters and cards .... There's just nothing left for me to do here but unhook the stars .... Do you remember when I told you all that I could and it seemed like too much .... Well I was living your life hoping you'd never fall .... If I held on tight enough .... And letting go now is like a passport to anywhere .... With time on my hands I can make a new start .... I just didn't want to stay here and unhook the stars. I just didn't want to stay here and unhook the stars. Don't worry for me it's just I'm inspired. Waiting in the wings made me drunk with possibility. It rivals my memories ....

4941,"Is this what I wish for those and all they know?. Could depend on how cowardly I should act. If she won't give me the love I came here for. With pen I am armed here to react. Hey now hey now what is it boy?. All the things that trouble you. So visit your mirror image. Of what might have once behaved. Hey now hey now what is it boy?. But I won't rest till dead till dead do you part. This is how I feel my God from what's been dealt. The flies that flutter fight tonight. Is it love that I'm feeling or is this hate the same. The emotion's enough to kill the sane. Hey now hey now what is it boy?. All the things that trouble you. So visit your mirror image. Of what might have once behaved. Hey now hey now what is it boy?. Besides I only hope you know that I love you.. Oh I hope.. Feed little maggots off the Westside of your sin. Run little maggot when they learn of what you did. Feed little maggots off the Westside of your sin. Run little maggot when they learn of what you did. (Fe este dia que hora) [x4]. From start to finish I've made you feel this. Discomfort in turn with the world you've learned. To love through this hate to live with its weight. A burden discerned in the blood you taste. Why would you deny me answers?. If I'm just a boy on the break of being. Horror and hell through its fires. Be brutally honest was it better before me?. In the curve of your body. How I want how I want her with me. The truth of the story. The Vishual I wish you all. The better end of all to come. The truth be now here one by one. I am to you extend to none. The memory that fuels the fire. Watching his tale with the words he unfolds. Conscience and cold we'd never know. They scream as he laughs off the dust from his eyes. These words will now learn of the dreams in his mind. Could this be that hard for me?. To configure a new love in hate. To my new entity or banish it home to the grave. No one is safe. With the quickness strike out for the less of us doubt. Mercy of the man who put the pen in our mouth. Word write us well signed ""Forgiveness for sale"". I'm through being full. Of all the might you want killed. The fiction will see the real. The answer will question still. In your body to blood as your parents once went. You will follow their lead one by one every step. Could this be that hard for me?.

Out of some sentimental gain I wanted you to feel my pain. But it came back return to sender. I read your mind and tried to call. My tears could fill the Albert Hall. Is this the sound of sweet surrender?. What a shame we never listened. I told you through the television. And all that went away was the price we paid. People spend a lifetime this way. Oh what a shame. So I got busy throwing everybody underneath the bus. And with your poster 30 foot high at the back of Toys-R-Us. I wrote a letter in my mind. But the words were so unkind. About a man I can't remember. I don't recall the reasons why. I must have meant them at the time. Is this the sound of sweet surrender?. What a shame we never listened. I told you through the television. And all that went away was the price we paid. People spend a lifetime this way. And that's how they stay. Oh what a shame. Words come easy when they're true.

4952,"Well I was born. The year that disco died. And U2 was in high school. Thank the Lord that they survived. Got my first taste on a seger 45. And since that Kiss. I've rocked all day and partied every night. And we still argue 'bout who's better. Elton John or Billy Joel. And we still wonder. If Kurt really wrote the song. She sang in Hole. No we'll never stop believing. It's the journey of our lives. So won't you help me pour some sugar. On these memories tonight?. Singin'. Long live Rock long live Roll. Long live big guitars and music for the soul. Sayin'. Don't give up don't grow old. Long live crazy nights and records made of gold. Long live rock and roll. Summer of 96 I got my first guitar. And played it 'til my fingers said. ""You're gonna be a star"". Grunge was everything at least it was to me. A Marshall in my Chevy Sprint. Just running down a dream. We still argue 'bout who's better. Mötley Crüe or GnR. And we still can't believe Van Helen. Turned into Van Hagar. Now the record shops are gone for good. And no one seems to care. But me and you and all our friends. Keep living on that prayer. Singin'. Long live Rock long live Roll. Long live big guitars and music for the soul. Sayin'. Don't give up don't grow old. Long live crazy nights and records made of gold. Long live rock and roll. Went to bed in Cleveland. Woke up in Tenessee. No matter where I roam tonight. I'm chasing history. We still argue 'bout who's better. The Beatles or the Stones. They're forever 27. Jimi Janis Brian Jones. And we stand here in their memory. 'Cause the songs they still survive. So throw your lighters up. And darling sing with me tonight. Come on. Long live Rock long live Roll. Long live big guitars and music for the soul. Sayin'. Don't give up don't grow old. Long live crazy nights and records made of gold. Long live rock and roll. Long live Rock long live Roll. Long live big guitars and music for the soul. Sayin'. Don't give up don't grow old.

4954,It can be born anywhere. In the last place you'd expect. In a way you'd never dream. It can grow from nothing. And blossom in a second. A single glance is all it takes. To get inside you. Invading every thought. And every bit of your heart. Love can make you scream. and it can leave you speachless. Love has a thousand stems but only one flower. It can grow alone till it turns into dust. It can tear your world apart. Or bind to you forever. It can grow in darkness make its own light. Turn a curse into a kiss. change the meaning of your words. Love makes no sense love has no name. Love drowns you in tears. And it sets your heart on fire. Love has no fear love has no reason. So infinitely vast and we're standing on the edge. Take my hand and erase the past forever. My love is you my love you are. Love makes no sense love has no name. Love is never wrong and never needs a reason. I'm drowning in my tears. But my heart's on fire. It can make you better it can change you slowly. And give you everything you want. Ask for nothing in return. In the blink of an eye the hint of a smile. In the way you say goodbye. And everytime you find me. Love makes no sense love has no name. Love drowns you in tears. And it sets your heart on fire. Love has no fear love has no reason. Love makes no sense love has no name. Love drowns you in tears. And it sets your heart on fire. Love has no fear love has no reason. My love is you my love you are. My love is you my love you are

4959,"It's leavin time again. I'm headed out with all my friends. It's a roll of the dice. I've never thought twice. About the way I've been spending my time. Trying my guts out for every dime. Working in an office building tall. Don't know who's next to you at all. But being out here. The blood the guts the beer. Is a test. Only time will tell. It brings you close man. Closer than hell. CHORUS:. We're leaving leaving again. Can't recall where all we been. I guess we'll just go. Go till we're too old. Or we run out of road. The other day I talked to Lou. He quit back in '92. Says he misses it bad. Those were the best times he ever had. He said ""Give it hell to the end. 'Cause once you quit. You can't get it back again"". CHORUS:. We're leaving leaving again. Can't recall where all we been. I guess we'll just go. Go till we're too old. Or we run out of road. BRIDGE:. Expensive cabs and shitty food. Washed down with cancelled flights. This week endorsement holidays. You miss your boy and wife. Oh the late night drives the calls. The dawn to strike you like a knife. Hey man this is a beautiful life. We're leaving again leaving again.... CHORUS (x2):. We're leaving leaving again. Can't recall where all we been. I guess we'll just go. I guess we'll just go. I guess we'll just go.

4960,Oh my god a winter for a year. Oh my god a winter for a year. And I cleaned out the back of my wardrobe for a year. Jackets never turn into branches. Not while you're not here. Oh my god a winter for a year. Oh my god a winter for a year. I kept my life so cold. Every breath just fogs up all the mirrors. The tears are frozen long. Long before I ever thought of crying. So ends my yearlong romance. With radio towers and machines. Wasted all my prayers. That I can't remember my dreams. But I don't mind. Oh my god a winter for a year. Oh my god a winter for a year. And I cleaned out the back of my wardrobe for a year. Jackets never turn into branches. Not while you're not here. So ends my yearlong romance. With radio towers and machines. Wasted all my prayers. That I can't remember my dreams. But I don't mind. No I don't. No I don't care anymore
4961,Met her at a friendly little bar down along the coast. She said it was her birthday so we had us a nice little toast. Drove around for a while smoked a few cigarettes. Took her back to my place she slipped off her party dress. She sat for a while on the edge of the bed just talkin'. Loose change in my pocket. Loose change in my pocket. Pint of gin in my boot cuff I'm drivin' for a drink and a dance. Sittin' on the next stool miss a little time on her hands. Yeah I knew she was trouble but trouble sure was lookin' fine. And when I pulled her close what I knew kinda slipped my mind. We lay in bed and watched the moon come up crawling. Loose change in my pocket. Loose change in my pocket. I pour another drink wait for the night to get through. Stars are burning in that black void so far away and blue. Now I'm sittin' at a red light I feel somethin' tickin' way down. The night's moving like a slow train crawling through this shithole town. Got my bags packed in the back and I'm tryin' to get going again. But red just goes to green and green goes red and then. Then all I hear's the clock on the dash tick-tocking. Loose change in my pocket. Loose change in my pocket.
4962,"Mike was right when he said I'd put up. A fight to be someone a fight to be me. But see now I'm down. Under the pavement. Of Capitals hills and lowercase people. As time rolls by my dreams have. become. That which is attainable. Now what I'm looking for!. I've got the company car. I'm the one swinging at two below par. Yeah I've become one with the ones. That I've never believed in. But I've got the company car. (Hey)I'm the king of things I've always. despised. I'm the gingerbread man. Who got eaten alive. I'm half baked! I'm fake!. But see I've got hotels on. Park Place and Boardwalk. And two hundred bucks. I pass go but oh! Life's taken it's toll. Have I won monopoly to forfeit my soul?. All the kings horses. At the foot of the wall. They're taking pictures of. The man who's last all of his. Masks of pretension. He's got two faces left. His is the one that he hides. On the left behind that smile. Hiding tears and fear. That burn like an engine. It drives him away. From the ones that he loves. Mike was right:. ""Hey Mike! We're one and the same;. We're the faceless combatants in the. loneliest game"". Ah but say I'll wave as I'm driving by. With that smirk in my eye yelling. ""Hey I'm something man check me. out!""."
4963,I got a secret. It's on the tip of my tongue. It's on the back of my lungs. And I'm gonna keep it. I know something you don't know. It sits in silence; eats away at me. It feeds like cancer. This guilt could fill a fucking sea. Pulling teeth wolves at my door. Now falling and failing is all I know. This disease is getting worse. I counted my blessings now I'll count this curse. The only thing I really know. I can't sleep at night. I'm buried and breathing in regret. I got a secret. It's on the tip of my tongue. It's on the back of my lungs. And I'm gonna keep it. I know something you don't know. I may look happy but honestly dear. The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear. I see the vultures they watch me bleed. They lick their lips as all the shame spills out of me. Repent repent! The end is nigh. Repent repent! We're all gonna die. Repent repent! These secrets will kill us. So get on your knees and pray for... forgiveness. We all carry these things inside that no one else can see. They hold us down like anchors they drown us out at sea. I look up to the sky there may be nothing there to see. But if I don't believe in him... Why would he believe in me?. Why would he believe in me?. Why would he believe in me?. Why would he believe in me?. Why would he believe in me?. I got a secret. It's on the tip of my tongue. It's on the back of my lungs. And I'm gonna keep it. I know something you don't know. I got a secret. It's on the tip of my tongue. It's on the back of my lungs. And I'm gonna keep it. I know something you will never know. You will never know. I know something you don't know
4964,Could you be the one for me. Standing by me all this time. I ain't sure I believe it. But something just tells me I'm right. Know that I really shouldn't stay. But I just can't walk away. Even though you can't be mine. I think about you all the time. When I go. I leave my heart in your hands. So take good care. Cos it ain't safe with me. I can't take the pain. Of loving you so. But I just can't let you go. No I just can't let you go. Can't you see it's hard for me. To play along like I'm okay. Were we made for each other. Or will we let love slip away. What if I never find a love like you. What will I do (when I). Wanna feel your hand in mine (and I). Need to look into your eyes
4965,Rise with me now. And we'll walk to the shore. We'll look over the waves. To the break of day. I'll hold your hand. I'll hold you close. I'll wipe away your tears. And no one will know. I'm the morning tide. We'll hoist the sails to break the crushing waves. Won't you come with me and hear the ocean side?. And if to its depths it called us by our names. Won't you sail to the shore with me?. Come to me now. And together we'll go. Where the clear winds blow. Far and beyond. Leave in behind. All our sorrow and pride. Kissin' them goodbye. Into another life. I'm the morning tide. We'll hoist the sails to break the crushing waves. Won't you come with me and hear the ocean side?. And if to its depths it called us by our names. Won't you sail to the shore with me?. Won't you come with me?. Sail to the shore with me. Won't you come with me?. Come with me?. Come with me?. Sail. Love is still here. Never will it leave. You're always with me. And I'm always with you. I'm the morning tide. We'll hoist the sails to break the crushing waves. Won't you come with me and hear the ocean side?. And if to its depths it called us by our names. Won't you sail to the shore with me?. And we'll hoist the sails to break the crushing waves. Won't you sail to the shore with me?
4966,Fuck I’m drunk. But I’m off my knees. The police stopped chasing. I’m her new cool meat. She pops the trunk. And she removes me. And a machine that takes. Pictures of us. Now my jaw and my teeth hurt. I’m choking from gnawing on the ball. And just before I come to move to. The back of the car she makes me. Touch the machine. New murderer. First untie me. Untie me for now. You said you would right?. And you were right. (soon I’ll let you go). Soon this will be all over. Well I hope soon. She sang. So she sang. (soon I’ll let you go).

4975,I have been unfaithful. I have been untrue. Now I found the road that. Brought me back to you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In this crowded city. I was so alone. Stranger to my own eyes. Heart without a home. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. On the Riverside Drive. On the red of night. In the churches of Brooklyn. Underneath the Chelsea lights. Up in Battery Park. And in Morningsight Heights. Hallelujah. Suns are in the sky now. Suns are in my veins. Throw me in the fire now. Love is what remains. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Ooh
4976,When you found somebody new I thought I never would. Forget you for I thought then that I never could. But time has taken all my pain away. Until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day. Once a day all day long. And once a night from dusk till dawn. The only time I wish that you weren't gone. Is once a day every day all day long. And I'm so glad I'm not like a friend that I knew one time. He lost the one he loved and then he slowly lost his mind. Sat around and cried his life away. Lucky me I'm only hurtin' once a day. Once a day all day long. And once a night from dusk till dawn. The only time I wish that you weren't gone. Once a day every day all day long. Once a day all day long. And once a night from dusk till dawn. The only time I wish that you weren't gone. Is once a day every day all day long. Once a day every day all day long. Once a day every day all day long
4977,It's the hardest part when you stop believing. And you want too much so you keep deceiving. Is there enough to share or are we destined to fight. Between the darkness and the light?. I'll have everything I need if I leave it behind. I'm gonna walk this path as if I'm blind. So hold on to what's good cause there's not a lot of it. We all have hearts but we've all got demons. You wanted to fall and I tried to save you. Oh you had it all when they took it away from you. You wanted to fall now there's nothing left to lose. I thought it'd be easy but the dream it ended. I've had enough of always pretending. I tried to leave the train from the first class cabin. But the desert was dry and the wind was howling. We've had too much and we lost the thrill of it. We've had so much but it was never enough. You wanted to fall and I tried to save you. Oh you had it all when they took it away from you. You wanted to fall and they took it away from you. You had it all now there's nothing left to lose. We will never grow old. No we will never grow old. You wanted to fall and I tried to save you. And you had it all when they took it away from you. You wanted to fall and they took it away from you. You had it all now there's nothing left to lose. You got nothing left to lose. We will never grow old. No we will never grow old
4979,Wait forever for your love. Make believe that we're the only ones. Holding on to whispers of your love. All we are is a dream beyond the dawn

4983,[Hook: Shanell]. Said yes but I know. Youre really not that sure. Cause your eyes dont tell no lies. Walkin' that road left everything you know. The mask you wear dont cover the windows to your soul. Cause your eyes dont tell no lies your eyes dont tell no lies. [Verse 1: Legacy]. Ever since a child he wanted to be a rapper. Someone said he'd do anything to make it happen. Daddy died gang bangin momma on drugs. Got a best friend but that nigga locked up. Had a girlfriend that'd be there if he lonely. Till she got drunk and she smashed all the homies. Couldn't stop the pain even after jiggas song. Like alotta bad sex so many did him wrong. He started to rappin but not to give a message. He just knew his fans would love. When nobody else except it. And if he was good he'd get the models on the banners. And maybe make enough to buy the condo in atlanta. That he always wanted really wanted. Was the key to the window that will lead him to his fortune. Then at least people would greet him if he lonely. He'd be free if he got it so he started. [Hook: Shanell]. Walkin' that road left everything you know. The mask you wear dont cover the windows to your soul. Cause your eyes dont tell no lies your eyes dont tell no lies. [Verse 2: Legacy]. A year passed he finally got the deal. He wouldn't stop dreaming till he finally turnt it real. He froze at the question when they asked him how it feel. Saying he didn't do it for the love he just did it for his self. All the kids saw was a man with a chain. So they idolised him like the man was a game. He thought about buying a phantom a range. So that he could drive away from the past that he hate. He seemed like he beat every kid in the fame. He became even more distant from sane in the game. He ain't care about the stuff on his brain. If he said what he felt they would spit on his name. Kick him down help him up just to kick him down again. And then they burried him. so long they won't remember his face. But he kept his smile on when anybody greet him. He knows what shoes a kid suppose to be in. [Hook: Shanell]. (We) walkin' that road left everything you know. The mask you wear dont cover the windows to your soul. Cause your eyes dont tell no lies your eyes dont tell no lies
4984,She's no good for me. I know that she's. A wildflower. She's got a restlessness. A beautifulness. Thing about her. But here I am again. Callin her back. Lettin her drive me crazy. (chorus:). It's like I love this pain. A little too much. Love my heart all busted up. Somethin bout her. It just don't work. But I can't walk away. It's like I love this pain. It's just an on again. And off again. Situation. It's a strikin match. A tank of gas. Combination. But here I am again. Lightin it up. Knowin that she'll just burn me. (chorus). It's like I love this lie. But nothing's right. And something's wrong. It's like I'm just not me. If I can't be. A sad sad song. (chorus). Oh yeah. It's like I love this pain. I can't walk away. Oh no. It's like I love this pain
4985,In the city of dreams you get caught up in the schemes and fall. Apart in the seam... tonight. That boy he used to bomb from B.K. to the Bronx and it's the. Fortunate one who dies. [Nas:]. New York we ready!. [Kevin Rudolf:]. He move from LAS to SoHo. A few blocks for those who don't know. Down the hall. Punched a hole in the wall. Bounced out all are in control. Certified son of a gun. Learns life lesson 101. Don't fly too high. On your own supply-get burnt by the sun. Cause in the city of dreams. You get caught up in the schemes and fall apart in the. Seam... tonight. That boy he is the bomb from B.K. to the Bronx and it's the. Fortunate one who dies. He was NY's talk of the town. Heard out to the LI sound (okay).

Yo ok my city my town my crown. Michael Bloomberg forget what ya heard. I'm thought of highly shoppin Louie Gianni. Christian LaCrosse shades what can a boss say?. City bus the subway cab the runway. Ski masks and gunplay-my past at a young age. The illest city on the planet. Towers came down Wall Street barely standin. We Crook Brothers opposite of Brook Brothers. My footsteps of Scatman Crothers. It's just generations of style to get five luminous minutes with me. Interviews on how I flip sixty-twos. This isn't my style I spit what I'm livin right now. I'm out on the town gold bars shuttin it down. Bottles stacked from the floor to the ceiling. Then it's a loud fool fifty-third street right near the Hilton. I'm fightin the feeling I had when I was lightin up buildings. Now I'm writin for millions of listeners. Critics who just don't get it. They try dissin us New York full of kings and queens all the rest just mimic us. [Kevin Rudolf:]. Cause in the city of dreams. You get caught up in the schemes and fall apart in the. Seam... tonight. That boy would play his guitar like he was ready for war. And then he'd lift up his voice to the... sky

4991,(Translation To: Seemann). Come in my boat. a storm is rising. and it is becoming night. Where do you want to go. so completely alone. you are drifting away. Who holds your hand. when it pulls you under. Where do you want to go. the cold sea is boundless. Come in my boat. the autumn wind holds. the sails taut. Now you are standing by the lantern. with tears in your face. the daylight falls on the side. the autumn wind sweeps the streets clear. Now you are standing by the lantern. you have tears in your face. the evening light chases away the shadows. time stands still and it becomes autumn. Come in my boat. the helmsman feels longing.

4995,So your time has come. Children watch the fools. Don't let anyone tell you. What you must do. Do you like what you see. Or does it make you cry. Use your imagination. And start a fire.

Coming into view. Our hearts full of promises. Of all we can do. Hear that sound. There's a voice to be found. Making changes go round. Hear that sound. So your time has come.

4996,Turn me loose from your hands. Let me fly to distant lands. Over green fields trees and mountains. Flowers and forest fountains. Home along the lanes of the skyway. For this dark and lonely room. Projects a shadow cast in gloom. And my eyes are mirrors. Of the world outside. Thinking of the way. That the wind can turn the tide. And these shadows turn. From purple into grey. For just a Skyline Pigeon. Dreaming of the open. Waiting for the day. He can spread his wings. And fly away again. Fly away skyline pigeon fly. Towards the dreams. You've left so very far behind. Just let me wake up in the morning. To the smell of new mown hay. To laugh and cry to live and die. In the brightness of my day. I want to hear the pealing bells. Of distant churches sing. But most of all please free me. From this aching metal ring. And open out this cage towards the sun

5003,In the hallway down the staircase. Slowly opening the creaking door. Someone comes along and smiles. And for a moment all is quite the norm. Avoiding all the crowd below the sound of conversations spin. And patiently I wait in every corner for someone to come in. Dry'd in dust on darkened floors. A gasp resists with every buried breath. Watching shadows through the cracks. Of light that shape and sway with every step. So carefully and quietly and with an undetected hand. In comes a breeze it sweeps. The room and follows with a distant slam. Donned in bath kerchief the. Chambermaids unlock and let the daylight in. She spoke of trees and creeping things. And nestled foundlings in the starlight crib. With an unsaving clench a bribe. Under the cloak is unconcealed. And all her secrets now belong. Forever to whom she revealed. We build on wretched ruins thinly. Veiled below our skin & bones. Cowards sing each other's rhyme. And add a verse of all your wicked moans. It starts off as a whisper and grows. Into the deepest battle cry. Pressing ears and spying eyes. Await the beast we're nurturing inside. Questions fly and so do I the hole. Fills with our harshest stones unturned. 'Neath the cardhouse all my kings. Are buried and the queen won't say a word. We plant the tales they feed on us 'til. Accusations earn their wings. Sold out for sharpened tongues. And spit into the air these creeping things
5004,When I was a little girl I never was a princess type. I didn't do fairy tales or wish on stars at night. All the other girls are living in make believe. Searching for the one boy of their dreams. Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. Everywhere I go see a trail of broken hearts. And one by one I watch them fall apart. I told myself I won't let that be me. I'll take my time for ever after happily. I'll save my love for love in a land called far away. Until then well love your heart's gonna have to wait. When I find my love that I will love every day. Ooh ooh where hearts don't have to break. And I'll stay in love in a land called far away. Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. Run along little boy you're just distracting me. I've got things to learn and places I should be. Though I appreciate the way you feel for me. Truth is I'm miles away from feeling that kind of thing. I'll save my love for love in a land called far away. Until then well love your heart's gonna have to wait. When I find my love that I will love every day. Ooh ooh where hearts don't have to break. And I'll stay in love in a land called far away. Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. I'll be still til the day love comes calling me. Until that day I'll be fine. I'll save my love for love in a land called far away.

5005,I cleaned out your dresser found some joints. My sister smoked 'em I didn't see the point. And everyone keeps sayin' that I look just like you. Life don't seem so alone anymore. The day my daddy died I damn near quit the band. The day my daddy died I held my mama's hand. I cried my tears then dried 'em up. Put my face inside my hands. The day my daddy died I became a man. The cops came they did not take off their shoes. People hug me I smell like 10 000 perfumes. Gave away the wheelchair you're gone but I'm still here. January in Detroit is cold as fuck. The day my daddy died I damn near quit the band. The day my daddy died I held my mama's hand. I cried my tears then dried 'em up. Put my face inside my hands. The day my daddy died I became a man. The day my daddy died I became a man. I love you a lot. I love you too. Remind me to let you run away if you need to run places like the basement. I mean that's what it's a part isn't it? Being an individual. Yeah letting people go. Yeah. Remind me to let you go too if you need to. Absolutely. I love you. I love you so much. You're gonna put that into a song?
5007,A tireless stream of indifference flows. Through veins till the river runs dry. I no longer care I have all but disposed. Of dreams that I once held inside. Desire is gone after all of these years. The fight has been lost I concede. The apathy born a long time ago. Has grown to what I can’t defeat no. I’ve been here too long. I’m tired and longing for more. How long must I run. To find what I’m looking for?. All hope is gone. The sadness I carry so deep in my heart. For what could have been at my feet. It’s never forgotten it’s never too far. I’m wasted so warn and so weak. I’ve been here too long. I’m tired and longing for more. How long must I run. To find what I’m looking for?. All hope is gone. Ahhh… ah ah. Ahhh… ah ah. Ahhh… ah ah. (All hope is gone…). Solo. I’ve been here too long. I’m tired and longing for more. How long must I run. To find what I’m looking for?. I’ve been here too long. I’m tired and longing for more. 3x All hope is gone
5008,The wintergreen the juniper. The cornflower and the chicory. All the words you said to me. Still vibrating in the air. The elm the ash and the linden tree. The dark and deep enchanted sea. The trembling moon and the stars unfurled. There she goes my beautiful world. There she goes my beautiful world. There she goes my beautiful world. There she goes my beautiful world. There she goes again. John Willmot penned his poetry. riddled with the pox. Nabakov wrote on index cards. at a lectem in his socks. St. John of the Cross did his best stuff. imprisoned in a box.

5010,This papercut is so far from deep but just deep enough to cause it to bleed. While this kind of pain helps you to sleep it’s what I wake up to and why I scream. When separation becomes routine I turn the page and start over again. This frustration as you can see is what I’m becoming accustomed to. Now I come in peace to let you know what that was for me. So pass your time passing out and passing on the torches. Forgetting all the sources of your smile. It takes some time but look around and find a shoe that fits you. It probably won’t hit you for a while. Just take a step back and watch me bleed. Watch as it runs down my legs to the feet. At any time now this blood red sea will soak you and drown you. I hope you can swim for this is no ship or rescue team to save you from you. Just understand where we stand. This corrupts your plan to be fair and a friend. Wake up. Morning. Shower. Start Again. Do this alone. Alone I miss my friends. Don’t you miss your home? The home is where the heart is. In the night I had a dream. And in it you stood tall. So save you from you. Remember that we miss you and don’t forget the sources of your smile.
5011,Finished with my woman. Cause she couldn't help me with my mind. People think I'm insane. Because I am frowning all the time. All day long I think of things. But nothing seems to satisify. Think I'll lose my mind. If I don't find something to pacify. Can you help me. Occupy my brain oh yeah. I need someone to show me. The things in life that I can't find. I can't see the things that make. True happiness I must be blind. Make a joke and I will sigh. And you will laugh and I will cry. Happiness I can not feel. And love to me is so unreal. And so as you hear these words. Telling you now of my state. I tell you to enjoy life. I wish I could but it's too late.
5012,When they opened up the strip I was young and full of zip. I wanted a place to call my own.. And so I made the race and staked me out a place. And settled down along the Cimarron.. It blowed away it blowed away. My Oklahoma home it blowed away.. It looked so green and fair when I built my shanty there. But my Oklahoma home it blowed away.. I planted wheat and oats got some chickens and some shoats. Aimed to have some ham and eggs to feed my face.. Got a mule to pull the plow got an old red muley cow. And got a fancy mortgage on the place.. It blowed away it blowed away. All the crops I planted blowed away.. You can't grow any grain if there isn't any rain;. All except the mortgage blowed away.. It blowed away my rooster and it blowed away my hens;. The pigs and cattle went astray.. All the crops that I sowed went a-foggin' down the road.. My Oklahoma farm it blowed away.. It blowed away it blowed away. Everything I owned blowed away.. I hollered and I cussed when my land went up in dust. When my Oklahoma farm it blowed away.. It looked so green and fair when I built my shanty there. I figured I was all set for life.. I put on my Sunday best with my fancy scalloped vest. And went to town and picked me out a wife.. She blowed away she blowed away. My Oklahoma woman blowed away.. Just as I bent and kissed her she was picked up by a twister;. My Oklahoma woman blowed away.. Then I was left alone a-listenin' to the moan. Of the wind around the corners of my shack;. So I took off down the road when the south wind blowed. A-travelin' with the wind at my back.. I blowed away I blowed away. Chasin' a dust cloud up ahead.. Once it looked so green and fair now it's up there in the air;. My Oklahoma farm is overhead.. Now I'm always close to home no matter where I roam. For Oklahoma dust is everywhere.. Makes no difference where I'm walkin' I can hear my chickens squawkin'. I can hear my wife a-talkin' in the air.. It blowed away it blowed away. My Oklahoma home blowed away.. But my home is always near; it's in the atmosphere. My Oklahoma home that blowed away.. I'm a roamin' Oklahoman but I'm always close to home. And I'll never get homesick 'til I die.. No matter where I'm found my home is all around;. My Oklahoma home is in the sky.. It blowed away it blowed away. My farm down upon the Cimarron.. But all around the world wherever dust is whirled. Some is from my Oklahoma home.. It blowed away it blowed away. My Oklahoma home blowed away.. Oh it's up there in the sky in that dust cloud rolling by. My Oklahoma home is in the sky.
5013,Stone the world is stone. It's no trick of the light. It's hard on the soul. Stone the world is stone. Cold to the touch. And hard on the soul. In the grey of the streets. In the neon unknown. I look for a sign. That I'm not on my own. That I'm not here alone. As the still of the night. And the choke of the air. And the winners' delight. And the losers' despair. Closes in left and right. I would love not to care. Stone the world is stone. From a faraway look. Without stars in my eyes. Through the halls of the rich. And the flats of the poor. Wherever I go. There's no warmth anymore. There's no love anymore. So I turn on my heels. I'm declining the fall. I've had all I can take. With my back to the wall. Tell the world I'm not in. I'm not taking the call. Stone the world is stone. But I saw it once. With the stars in my eyes. When each colour rang out. In a thunderous chrome. It's no trick of the light. I can't find my way home. In a world of stone.
5014,Fake your way through a conversation. Tell her all the things you wish were true. Maybe you're the voice of a generation. And a princess somewhere waits for you. But if you're never gonna change the world. If you're never gonna be a movie star. If you're never gonna change the world. Maybe you're looking too hard. Don't synthesizer her. Don't redesign her. She's no prize for. A synthesizer. Pretend you meet your own expectations. Add another name along your list. Maybe you're the next world wide sensation. You probably know a thousand ones like this. But if you're never gonna change the world. If you're never gonna be a movie star. If you're never gonna change the world. Maybe you're looking too hard. Don't synthesizer her. Don't redesign her. She's no prize for. A synthesizer. Who you gonna call when the spotlight flickers. What you gonna do when your curtain falls. Maybe you can make them not remember her. Maybe you won't end up alone. Don't synthesizer her. Don't redesign her. She's no prize for. A synthesizer
5015,Today you looked around to my heart's call. This tiny life ain't been strangled after all. Time time time time. Never ask what's become of us. Just dedicate your sorrow. Here and now. To the soul of the sea. And me. Rushin' to me. You turned around to my song's call. You dreamer in the sand. Just lie there laughing til the fall. Kindest lover. I can't stay alone tonight. Bring me all your love. Here and now. Come rushin' to me. Wake up late. Without a smile. Telephone rings. You run like a child. On the street. Into the day. The people I meet. Have nothing to say. No smile. No sorrow. No laughter. No tomorrow. They talk hen to hen. They talk about their men. And practice all the tricks for them. Too soon nightime's coming on. Deep in the darkness feeling alone. No rain. No seed. No dreams. No silence. Far away today. Mama ocean hold me to you. Rock me on your waves. And tell me.... Is it all true?. Time time time time. Never ask what's become of us. Dedicate your sorrow. Here and now.
5019,Where did your long hair go. Where is the girl I used to know. How could you lose that happy glow. Oh Caroline no. Who took that look away. I remember how you used to say. You'd never change but that's not true. Oh Caroline you. Break my heart. I want to go and cry. It's so sad to watch a sweet thing die. Oh Caroline why. Could I ever find in you again. Things that made me love you so much then. Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone. Oh Caroline no
5021,Grey days. To be or not to be. Who are we. It's a mistery. Always. We have bleeded for. The Grail of life. Though it's just next door. The best you don't need to pay for. The best you don't wait to come. The best you don't need to pay for. Always on the run. Time flies. Many thousand years. And slowly. The stupor disappears. People. Stand up one by one. To find out. What makes the world go round. The best you don't need to pay for. The best you don't need to buy. The best you don't need to pay for. Recall and realise. The best you don't need to fight for. The best you don't wait to come. The best you don't need to pay for. Always on the run. The best you don't need to pay for

5024,Reborn and shivering. Spat out on new terrain. Unsure unconvincing. This faint and shaky hour. Day one day one start all over again. Step one step one. I'm barely making sense for now. I'm faking it til I'm pseudo making it. From scratch begin again but this time I as I. And not as we. Gun shy and quivering. Timid without a hand. Feign brave with steel intent. Little and hardly here. Day one day one start over again. Step one step one. With not much making sense just yet. I'm faking it til I'm pseudo making it. From scratch begin again but this time I as I. And not as we. Eyes wet toward. Wide open frayed. If God's taking bets. I pray He wants to lose. Day one day one start over again. Step one step one. I'm barely making sense just yet. I'm faking it till I'm pseudo making it. From scratch begin again but this time I as I. And not as we

5046,"We went down to the seaside. One cold frosty morning.. Just to go out for a drive. For an hour or two.. I walked down to the water. With my love and our baby.. Watched the waves breaking in. We're enjoying the view.. Then I heard myself saying. ""We should do this more often. To watch the little ones playing. On that bright stony shore."". And I wished deep down in my heart. That we could stay here forever.. In these sweet simple moments. That will come back no more.. When it's 3 o'clock in the morning. And something scared you from your breast. I will gently rock you in my arms. And lay your little head on my chest. And when you run from my arms. Know we'll always find you.. And when you run out of loving. And run home to me. (Run home to me). And the years fly by so quickly. Like a plane before my eyes. And you've grown up into a woman. Before I had time had time to realize.. And then you'll run from my arms. And we'll always come and find you.. And when you run out of loving. Then run home to me.. Lord when you run run out of my arms. We will always come and find you. And when you run out of loving. Then run home to me. (Run home to me)"

Burn out any memory of me ever breathing. Till I'm born again. I was thirsty. I remember that you gave me some water. I was angry. Everything at once you gave me no trouble. I was crying. I remember that you gave me your shoulder. Do that for me. It's the least that you can do. Don't be afraid. I would do the same for you. Burn out any memory of me ever breathing. Till I'm born again. Born again. Do that for me. It's the least that you can do. Don't be afraid. I would do the same for you. Burn out any memory of me ever breathing. Till I'm born again. Born again. Born again.

On the astral plane. Now I keep on thinkin'. My luck is gonna change. Someday. Bad Karma. It's uphill all the way. I can't run Can't hide. Can't get away. It must be my destiny. The same thing happens to me every day. Bad Karma. Coming after me. Bad Karma. Killing me by degrees. Bad Karma. Bad Karma. It's a dog's life. And it's not my fault. Ought to hang my picture.

5053,So close to the end now. Life is fading away. I'm not trying to figure out. What I've done is done 'till the grave. Now I can see through the ashes. Through the shades of grey. This cannot change. There is no one who's to blame. I'm losing my senses. In every breath that I take. All the sounds I'm hearing now. Are the dreams that I've left in my brain. Feeling numb in my hands. Out of blood in my veins. This cannot change. Am I falling from grace?. Last day on earth. Will I return?. My soul needs to rest. No links to the past. Death is my rebirth. Last day on earth. Will I return?. There's no need to ask. Let go of your past. Feel your soul burn. I know that I can't change what I am. I know that I can pray 'till the end. As I'm ending this journey. I'm looking back at my life. So many things I could have done. So vivid burn in my eyes. Now the circle is done. My soul is free to live again. The name carved in the stone. Is now released from the chain. Last day on earth. Will I return?. My soul needs to rest. No links to the past. Death is my rebirth. Last day on earth. Will I return?. There's no need to ask. Let go of your past. Feel your soul burn. Let it burn. Free your soul
5054,I'm a shepherd for the pentecost. I got my scriptures and my wires crossed. I got no kids and I got no home. They want us holy men to live alone. Since I've been here for a little stay. I see Rozetta day by day. She turns my head makes me cough. I want to tear my collar off. I just can't sleep at night. Rozetta dressed in white. She's got the Devil's light. Shining in her eyes. Screamed my sermon damning sin and vice. When underneath I was a regular guy. My pulpit melted like a block of ice. When a bolt of lightning hit me from the sky. From my stretcher when they wheeled me in. I stared directly in the eyes of sin. Nurse Rozetta standing over me. And I was helpless as a man of God could be. Nurse Rozetta I won't let her. Catch me peering down her sweater. Fantasizing silk suspenders on her thighs. Nurse Rozetta make me better. Secretly my eyes undress her. Let me feel your tongue depressor. I'm suddenly twice my size. My pants are all wet inside. She's so creative with a bar of soap. And so inventive with a stethoscope. To check my pulse she gotta hold my hand. I blow the fuse on the encephalogram. Satan sent her from the bowels of hell. I should have recognized old Jezbel. I surrendered to the urges felt. She popped the buckle on my bible belt. I just can't sleep at night. Rozetta dressed in white. She's got the Devil's light. Shining in her eyes. I'd lick her nylon seams. Like a hungry cat with cream. Oh what a vivid scene. And I can't hold back no more.

Oh where can I get my cock sucked. where can I get my arse fucked. I aint got no money. but I know where to put it every time. Well I asked a young policeman. if he'd only lock me up for the night. Well I've had pigs in the farmyard. - some of them some of them are alright. Well he fucked me with his truncheon. and his helmet was way too tight

So now she is crawling on her hands and her knees. She is dirtying her jeans choking on her own perfume. With a pen she writes below the sink in someone’s restaurant. ""This place is inconvenient for my name"". She forgets to write it anyway. She forgets to write it anyway. The government supplies the cocaine. Political scientists. There’s no guarantees.

And now I'm finding it hard to breathe. Our days have turned into mud (don't know don't think you know me). And now I know that I'm done. [Chorus]. You never call me by name. Think I want you to change. Think you know me. But you don't really know what I mean. You say I take it too deep. You think you know me. But you don't really know who I am. [Verse 2]. Now I'm seen the light. Paid the toll of our fights. I'm driving away from you. I won't get stuck in the past. How could you think this would last. You're just a bump in the road for me.

I been driving in sorrow. Chasing tomorrow. Running away. Now you're crossing the border. See no tomorrow. But you're not afraid. Our hopes and expectations. Black holes and revelations. Our hopes and expectations. Black holes and revelations. My plug in baby. Crucifies my enemies. When I'm tired of giving. My plug in baby In unbroken virgin realities. Is tired of living
5079,"Oh Danny boy the pipes the pipes are calling. From glen to glen and down the mountain side. The summer's gone and all the flowers are dying. 'Tis you 'tis you must go and I must bide. But come ye back when summer's in the meadow. Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow. 'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow. Oh Danny boy oh Danny boy I love you so. And if you come when all the flowers are dying. And I am dead as dead I well may be. You'll come and find the place where I am lying. And kneel and say an ""Ave"" there for me. And I shall hear tho' soft you tread above me. And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be. If you'll not fail to tell me that you love me. I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me. I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me"
5080,We're killing space and wasting time. And dying hard and spilling beans. We're moving fast on intuition. In the world of stupid things. We are the flyers. No return and no regrets and no delay. Into the frenzy this is crazy. Burning wheels to get away. (Chorus). Time of the moon. In the sky cloud is breaking. Voice of the doom. For the birds in the making. The time is wasted. On intuition. We are the flyers. Into the frenzy. We're spilling bids. On stupid things. With no delay. We get away. (Chorus). Time of the moon. In the sky cloud is breaking. Voice of the doom. For the birds in the making. No destination is the way. We're talking of accelerate. Get rid of garbage. Yes you may. They draw the bridge but it's too late. We are the final revelation. Shooting through the burning sky. Abandoned cargo hits the ground on broken wings. We are flying high
5081,It's cold outside. And the paint's peeling off of my walls. There's a man outside. In a long coat grey hat smoking a cigarette. Now the light fades out. And I wonder what I'm doing. In a room like this. There's a knock on the door. And just for a second I thought. I remembered you. So now I'm alone. Now I can think for myself. About little deals. And S.U's. And things I just don't understand. A white lie that night. Or a sly touch at times. I don't think it meant anything to you. So I open the door. It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway. 'Please sit down'. A candlelit shadow on a wall near the bed. You know I hate to ask. But are 'friends' electric?. Only mine's broke down. And now I've no-one to love. So I found out your reasons. For the phone calls and smiles. And it hurts. And I'm lonely. And I should never have tried. And I missed you tonight. It must be time to leave. You see it meant everything to me
5082,Sweetheart. I'm changing my role in life. I'm not re-arranging the main things in my life.. I ain't sacrificing what I hold as true. I ain't sacrificing sweetheart even for you..

5086,I don't wanna be left behind. Distance was a friend of mine. Catching breath in a web of lies. I've spent most of my life. Riding waves playing acrobat. Shadowboxing the other half. Learning how to react. I've spent most of my time. Catching my breath. Letting it go. Turning my cheek for the sake of this show. Now that you know. This is my life. I won't be told what's supposed to be right. Catch my breath. No one can hold me back. I ain't got time for that. Catch my breath. Won't let them get me down. It's all so simple now. Addicted to the love I found. Heavy heart now a weightless cloud. Making time for the ones that count. I'll spend the rest of my time. Laughing hard with the windows down. Leaving footprints all over town. Keeping faith Karma comes around. I won't spend the rest of my life. Catching my breath. Letting it go. Turning my cheek for the sake of this show. Now that you know. This is my life. I won't be told what's supposed to be right. Catch my breath. No one can hold me back. I ain't got time for that. Catch my breath. Won't let them get me down.

5090,"Friday night I'm on my way home. They oughta make work a crime. I'm home for the weekend. I'm gonna make the most of my time. There's a rock and roll singer on the television. Giving up his music gonna take up religion. Deserted rock and roll. To try to save his soul. Saturday night gotta gig with the band. Playing the electric guitar. Someday I'm gonna make it. Gonna be a super-duper-star. Get a flashy car. And a house for my Ma. The big break better happen soon. 'Cause I'm pushing twenty-one. Just like Cinderella. When she couldn't go to the ball. A voice said ""I'm your fairy manager. You shall play the Carnegie Hall"". I gotta give up my day job. To become a heartthrob. I may go far if I smash my guitar. Away for the weekend. I've gotta play some one-night stands. Six for the tax man and one for the band. Back in the studio to make our latest number one. Take two-hundred-and-seventy-six. You know this used to be fun. Monday morning I just got home. Six and the birds are singing. I need a drink and my clothes are wet. Ooh and my ears are still ringing. There's a rock and roll singer boppin' on the TV. He used to be a preacher but now he sings in a major key. Amended his decision to the new religion."

Step inside love and stay. Step inside love. Step inside love. Step inside love. I want you to stay. You look tired love let me turn down the light. Come in out of the cold.

5093,From faded newsprint used to wrap a fish. Inscrutably the muse selects your face. As I sit drinking famously in an Irish bar. Five thousand miles and thirty years away. With the usual ceremonial you were crowned one night. King of the field where doctors nail the cows. To make of the cock's quill the rights of language. And the pricking heart a sword against the hours. Let smirking scholars writhe in their favourite bondage. And hold you plaintiff to the charge of art. Exhibit A: he falls on legendary lines. Singing mother I don't want a pain here in my heart. The judge in me sucks eggs and jerks the sacred meat. But the boy in me still dreams in Milk Wood town. Like two provincial bastards playing the galleries. I hold your photo to a mirror upside down. And as bacon wafts through hungry streets your ghost pervades. Just like an old ex-boxer aged twenty two. Staged-up like Falstaff or the wild welsh Rimbaud. You'd laugh to see the monograms they make of you. Ah Mr. Thomas let us ramble through the midnight fair. Let us throw old bottles at the ferris wheel. Let us paint library on the library let us raid the moonlight. Let us steal whatever we are supposed to steal. Let us watch while the days grow daily more mundane. That rough God go riding with his shears. Hack wide the belly of the swollen mountains. And rip molten heroes forth from their furious tears. Oh Mr. Thomas oh Mr. Thomas. Let us steal whatever we're supposed to steal. Mr. Thomas oh Mr. Thomas. Why don't we feel whatever we're supposed to feel. Oh Mr. Thomas Mr. Thomas. Why don't we feel whatever we're supposed to feel. Oh Mr. Thomas let us ramble through the midnight. Let us throw bottles at the ferris wheel. Let us paint library on the library let us raid the moonlight. Let us steal whatever we're supposed to steal.
5094,Words & Music: Rickie Lee Jones. Hold me love I can't sleep again. Or will I have to kiss your lips. Oh I want to lay in this day in love. I remember walking in the rain. Rain is falling on my eyes. Oh I want to live through that again oh. Outside only it gets darker. And I was walking in the park now. And children singing songs. Of where we go our dreams come true. I'm in love with you. It only takes love. Love is a healing thing. When you give everything. All your love in the world. The world gives you love to hold on to. It remembers you 'cause all we're so wrong. I know I am. Somewhere I don't remember love. Just give me many chances. I'll see you through the storms. Just give me time to learn to grow. Just give me many chances. I'll see you through the wind. Just give me time to learn to grow. In September when the rain comes and the wind blows. I will see you walking in the cold alone. But if you'll let me I will keep you here inside the stars. I will love the sand on my sheets and you loving me in the dark. Somewhere I don't remember love. Just give me many chances. I'll see you through the storms. Just give time to learn to grow. Just give me many chances. I'll see you through the wind. Just give me time to learn to grow. Just give me many chances. I'll see you through the rain. Just give me time to learn time to learn to grow oh. Just give me many chances. I'll see you through it all. Just give me time to learn to grow. Time to learn to grow.

Lying here without you by my side. Lying here without you by my side. The room fills with moonlight and memories of old times. but don't worry about me I'm just fine most of the time.. The hardest part is late night when I'm home all alone. and the house is so still nothing better to do than think about you.. I'm Lying here without you by my side. I'm Lying here without you by my side. How quick my heart wants to believe I'll never be lonely again.. It's those little things I never thought about much that I miss most in the. end.. Like those sweet red-wine kisses and the candlelight. and the poetry but mainly it's just the warmth of your skin. and having you by my side. I'm Lying here without you by my side. There's this weight in my heart it's so heavy so sad. it felt like a wave that any moment comes crashing down. and maybe my sorrow will drown tomorrow. when I'm lying here without you by my side. I'm Lying here Without You by my Side. . Transcribed by Adam Longfellow.

5113,I don't know about the travel of time. And I've never seen most of the world. I don't know. Diving out of the sky. Or living like the diamonds of pearls. See I haven't danced to a musical tune. And I haven't noticed the flowers in bloom. I haven't smiled. When alone in my room very much. Then we touched. I just know. When you put your hands on me. I feel sexy. And my body turns to gold. i just know. When you put your hands on me. I feel ready. And I lose my self control. I don't know if a doll can unwind. Or how to make a person go. I don't know how to be what you like. And simply open up the depths of my soul. So I keep my wings. And my eyes on the down. Ready for nothing. But holding my ground. I haven't used. A particular noun very much. Then we touched. I won't notice. Or pay you no mind. Boy I couldn't care less. what you do with your time. Your fingertips on my hips. Just move me like one of a kind.
5114,We haven't met and that's okay. 'Cause you will be asking for me one day. Don't want to wait in line. The moment is mine believe me. Don't close your eyes. 'Cause it's a chance worth takin'. And I think that I can show you. CHORUS:. I know where I stand. I know who I am. I would never run away when life gets bad. Everything I see. Every part of me. Gonna get what I deserve. I got nerve. Electrified I'm on a wire. Getting together and we're on fire. What I said you heard. Now I got you spinning. Don't close your mind. The words I use are open. And I think that I can show you. Chorus 2:. I know where I stand. I know who I am. I would never run away when life gets bad. Everything I see. Every part of me. I know I can change the world yeah yeah yeah. I know what you like. I know what you think. Not afraid to stare you down until you blink. Everything I see. Every part of me. Gonna get what I deserve. I got nerve. Chorus 2:. I know where I stand. I know who I am.

5119,I'm standing in the center of the room. I watch the boys follow girls perfume. All is as it should be I assume. Except for the distance between me and you. You're standing as a flower on the wall. The room is still but we're about to fall. And all the names that brought us here. Simply fade away .... Who you are is falling over me. (Who you are is falling over me). Who you are is everything I need. (Who you are is everything I need). I'm hoping. I'm waiting. I'm praying you are the one. And I'm hoping. I'm waiting.

5120,No one ever told me. No one ever said. No one ever loved me. Til I was going out of my head. No one ever listened. To the things I tried to share. You gave me everything i needed. It's your way. You gave me hope. You give me love. You give me faith to carry on. (Chorus). Good God have mercy on me. Don't you desert me baby. I want to be together soul on soul this time. Believe me baby don't every leave me lonely. I want to be together soul on soul this time. No one ever held me. As good as this before. No one ever stopped me. When I was running out of the door.

I don't lose my way when you're here by me. (Chorus)
5121,Its morning time wonder where you are. Wonder who youre talking to. Wonder if the sun has risen where you are. Its morning time I miss your hands on my skin. This beds too big without you. Oh god what do I do?. Im a thousand miles away and Im lying next to you.. The sun shines golden and I feel like my car. A little run down a little beat up maybe just a. little green. Maybe its my battery maybe its my starter. Maybe my hearts too weak. Theres just this feeling thought I had to get going. Got too scary got too big got to get out of here. But now I dont know how to get home.. Oh god what do I do?. Im a thousand miles away and lying next to you.. Mama says take my vitamins. Daddy says girl dont stay out so late. Sister says theres other fishes in the sea. But love is not a rational thing and my heart is. beyond advice. No love is not a rational thing. Oh god what do I do?. Im a thousand miles away and lying next to you.. These fields stretch out like patchwork on my grannys. quilt. She used to tell me that. Life is a series of strange and mysterious things. One minute you think youre up the next you find youre. down. Your mind says girl you gotta stick around. But your heart says Im too weak in the knees. Oh god what do I do?. Im a thousand miles away and lying next to you.
5122,I think it's time to realize it's done. I guess I have to accept it. I was never the one. Yeaaah it was so good. I thought I fell into someone else's dream. Yeah but I let it be my thought to let be yours. Now nothing's ever what it seems. I thought I felt it all around. But now it's laying there on the ground. Why was it there for me. But not for you?. Tell me tell me. It comes as bliss of love. Now I'm sitting here. And you're so far gone. I'm staring down the page in a magazine. I looked up at the Tv but it's just too discrete. When we're together I thought it was ecstasy. Oh I can tell the sun's still shining. But shadows are all I can see. And everywhere I go. I'll never see your face I know. What could I say. That could make you come back this way. Tell me tell me. It comes as bliss of love. Now I'm sitting here. And you're so far gone. Now I know I should have known. And I see I could have seen. You gotta rest your soul. I need to know I want to find out. If your fields are still green whoaaa. Now I hope that what I have found. Could somehow be true. Why is it such a long long way and you. Tell me tell me. It comes as bliss of love now I'm sitting here. And you're so far gone.
5123,Well The Rest Of My Life Lay In Front Of Me. I Was Pedalling Down The Road. When I Saw Nell Gwynne And Her Oranges. And I'll Have One Of Those.. She Said Move Over Busker Don't Bang Your Drum. Move Over Busker Your Time Will Come.. Well I Was Hanging Around For A Miracle. Struggling With A Rhyme. When I Saw Mae West In A Sweaty Vest. And I Said I'll Come Up And See You Sometime.. She Said Move Over Busker Don't Bang Your Drum. Move Over Busker Your Time Will Come.. You've Got It Coming Come On Come On. You've Got It Coming Coming To You.. You've Got It Coming Come On Come On. You've Got It Coming Coming To You.. Well I've Been Waiting But I'm Impatient. No-One Can Hold Me Back I Want To Stay With The Action.. But I Won't Get It My Great Illusion. Will Vanish Anyhow If I Don't Grab It Now.. Well I Was Hacking My Way Throught The Undergrowth. Juggling With My Pride. When I Saw Errol Flynn In A Tiger Skin. And I Said You Look Satisfied!!. Well He Looked Down At Me From His Motor Home. And He Gave Me A Dirty Smile. He Said Well Yes I Am But She's Calling Me. Would You Excuse Us For A While. Move Over Busker Your Day Is Done..
5125,The lamp is burnin' low upon my table top. The snow is softly fallin'. The air is still within the silence of my room. I hear your voice softly callin'. If I could only have you near. To breathe a sigh or two. I would be happy just to hold the hands I love. Upon this winter night with you. The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead. My glass is almost empty. I read again between the lines upon the page. The words of love you sent me. If I could know within my heart. That you were lonely too. I would be happy just to hold the hands I love. Upon this winter night with you. The fire is dying now my lamp is growing dim. The shades of night are liftin'. The mornin' light steals across my windowpane. Where webs of snow are driftin'. If I could only have you near. To breathe a sigh or two. I would be happy just to hold the hands I love. And to be once again with with you. To be once again with with you
5127,Hello little girl.. Hello little girl.. Hello little girl.. When I see you every day. I say mmm-mmm hello little girl.. When you're passing on your way. I say mmm-mmm hello little girl.. When I see you passing by. I cry mmm-mmm hello little girl.. When I try to catch your eye. I cry mmm-mmm hello little girl.. I send you flowers. But you don't care.. You never seem to. See me standin' there.. I often wonder. What you're thinkin' of.. I hope it's me. And love love love.. So I hope there'll come a day when. You say mmm-mmm you're my little girl.. It's not the first time. That it's happened to me.. It's been a long lonely time. And it's so funny. So funny to see. That I'm about to loose. My mind mind mind.. So I hope there'll come a day when. You say mmm-mmm you're my little girl.. Mmm-mmm you're my little girl.. Mmm-hmm you're my little girl.. Oh yeah you're my little girl.
5128,Raise the sky.. We got to fly over the land over the sea.. Fate unwinds and if we die souls arise.. God do not seize me please till victory.. Take arms. Take aim. Be without shame. No one to bow to to vow to to blame.. Legions of light virtuous flight. Ignite excite.. And you will see us coming V formation through the sky.. Film survives. Eyes cry.. On the hill hear us call through a realm of sound.. Oh oh-oh. Down and down.. Down and round oh down and round.. Round and round oh round and round.. Rend the veil and we shall sail.. The nail the grail: That's all behind thee.. In deed in creed the curve of our speed.. And we believe that we will raise the sky.. We got to fly over the land over the sea.. Fate unwinds and if we die souls arise.. God do not seize me please till victory..

Where young lovers go. Sparks flashing in the night. True colors show. If I had my way I'd never. get the urge to roam. But a young man serves his country. and an old man guards the home. Don't put me in a frame upon the mantel. 'Fore memories turn dusty old and grey. Don't leave me alone in the twilight. 'Cause twilight is the loneliest time a day. I can face the darkness or. The storms in the sky. But we all got certain trials. burnin' up inside. You only hurt yourself. You don't know what you're doing. Trying to make it all alone. Who you thinking you're fooling?. Don't hand me nothing I can't hold. Or nothing that I can't give away. Don't leave me alone in the twilight. 'Cause twilight is the loneliest time a day

5146,There's a mouse starin' out of the window. His car is trapped in the snow. He's planning a family vacation. But he just can't go. Around the next corner's a red bird. His feathers are trapped in a sling. He's passed by some gunslinging parrot. Who's jealous he ain't got no grin. There ain't no time to stash the gumbo. Or rattle around in a cage. The sacrificed child's made bubbles. And spittle is everywhere enraged. In a hot sand or in a my feet. They're blistered and caked with debris. Chez rolez is guarding the tote board. While angry piddles with glee. There's a fool writing notes out on sandpaper. He's sending them off to himself. He gets them a couple days later. Who put them along his top shelf. If you get tired of shavings. And carve up a good hunk of wood. Remembering to check on the sausage. He's got cooking somewhere look good
5149,I’m the singer I’m the singer in the band. You’re the loser I won’t dismiss you out of hand. Cos you’ve got a beautiful face. It will take you places. You kept running. You’ve got money you’ve got fame. Every morning I see your picture from the train. Now you’re an actress!. So says your résumé. You’re made of card. You couldn’t act your way out of a paper bag. You got lucky you ain’t talking to me now. Little Miss Plucky. Pluck your eyebrows for the crowd. Get on the airplane. You give me stomach pain. I wish that you were here. We would have had a lot to talk about. We had a deal there. We nearly signed it with our blood…. An understanding. I thought that you would keep your word. I’m disappointed. I’m aggravated. It’s a fault I have I know. When things don’t go my way I have to. Blow up in the face of my rivals. I swear and I rant I make quite an arrival. The men are surprised by the language. They act so discreet they are hypocrites so fuck them too!. I always loved you. You always had a lot of style. I’d hate to see you on the pile. Of ‘nearly-made-it’ s. You’ve got the essence dear. If I could have a second skin. I’d probably dress up in you. You’re a star now I am fixing people’s nails. I’m knitting jumpers I’m working after hours. I’ve got a boyfriend I’ve got a feeling that he’s seeing someone else. He always had thing for you as well. Blow in the face of my rivals. I swear and I rant I make quite an arrival. The men are surprised by the language. They act so discreet they are hypocrites forget them. So fuck them too!
5150,"Opened up a box of you. Piece of paper or two with my name written on it. And a question mark. Who is this girl I have made?. Cause I've been kept in the dark. And I've seen you once father. In the fear of your belts and leather. And you were just about to tempter. There was distance. You're my spout resistance. I can't believe you still don't know me. Cause I am a mystery. So I separated all the things that I have hated. With the victories I have won. And the biggest one is you. You don't know my street or. The size of my feet or the time it took to grow. Cause father these are things you should know. These are things you should know. Knocked the breath right out of you. What's a brown eye girl to do?. When her future lies and chasing paper. And all I get from you is your. ""You're so clever I'll see you later"". I just cant hide my frustration. When there's so much more you could have done like. Given me hope and attention. Instead of ignored. But I don't mind no I don't mind. Cause he is just a boy. Cause we are children we are merely children. And he is just a boy. So I separated all the things that I have hated. With the victories I've won. And the biggest one is you. You don't know my street. Or the size of my feet or. Or the time it took to grow. Cause father these are things you should know"

5155,Last To Die. We took the highway till the road went black. We marked Truth Or Consequences on our map*. A voice drifted up from the radio. We saw the voice from long ago. Who'll be the last to die for a mistake. The last to die for a mistake. Whose blood will spill whose heart will break. Who'll be the last to die for a mistake. The kids asleep in the backseat. We're just countin' the miles you and me. We don't measure the blood we've drawn anymore. We just stack the bodies outside the door. Who'll be the last to die for a mistake. The last to die for a mistake. Whose blood will spill whose heart will break. Who'll be the last to die for a mistake. The wise men were all fools. What to do. The sun sets in flames as the city burns. Another day gone down as the night turns. And I hold you here in my heart. As things fall apart. A downtown window flushed with light. Faces of the dead at five (faces of the dead at five). A martyr's silent eyes. Petition the drivers as we pass by. Who'll be the last to die for a mistake. The last to die for a mistake. Whose blood will spill whose heart will break. Who'll be the last to die. Who'll be the last to die for a mistake. The last to die for a mistake. Darlin' your tyrants and kings form the same fate. Strung up at your city gates. And you're the last to die for a mistake
5156,"Hee!. Live and sin. Ten years ago on this day my heart was yearning. I promised I would never ever be returning. Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning. Hee! Hee!. As we walked into the room. There were faces staring glaring tearing through me. Someone said ""Welcome to your doom"". Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me. This is scaring me!. This is Heartbreak Hotel. Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel. So this is Heartbreak Hotel. This place is Heartbreak Hotel. Someone stop my heart!. This is Heartbreak Hotel. Hee!. Ten years ago today!.

5157,Winds may blow o'er the icy sea. I'll take with me the warmth of thee. A taste of honey. A taste much sweeter than wine. I'll leave behind my heart to wear. And may it ever remind you of. A taste of honey. A taste much sweeter than wine. I will return I will return. I'll come back for the honey and you. He never came back to his love so fair. And so she died dreaming of his kiss. His kiss of honey. A kiss more bitter than wine. I will return I will return. I'll come back for the honey and you. (I'll come back I'll come back). He never came back to his love so fair. And so she died dreaming of his kiss. His kiss of honey. A kiss more bitter than wine. I will return I will return. I'll come back for the honey and you. (I'll come back I'll come back).

5161,Death becomes clearer through bloodshot eyes. As a death from old age becomes nearer. Why can't the livestock be free?. When trading soldiers for steak. Lean to evolve with the new transition.

Every word's a whisper without you. But we don't have the money. (money makes the wheels and the world go round). Forget about it honey. Trouble's never far away when you're around. I didn't see it coming. I'm just not in the running. Take me on a train 'cos I'm not flying. I can see the world from a different side. Read about us in the morning papers. When we make it alive. I didn't see it coming. I'm just not in the running. And we don't need a lifetime. We're following the right line

Take the flight of a butterfly drop dead. Hear the whisper of the bullet's pace. Have you ever felt; heartbreak bullet kiss your. heart?. Scream goodbye. You're dropping dead. And it's all over. Say hello to the clock counting down the seconds. The bullets pace your beating heart point A point B!. Let's see how quick you are. Whether you'll risk it all on the line just to gain some ground. To show you can soak up the shots fired. Take the flight of a butterfly drop dead. Hear the whisper of the bullet's pace. Have you ever felt; heartbreak bullet kiss your. heart?. Butterfly you gotta race the bullet's pace. Butterfly you gotta race the bullet's whisper. Butterfly don't fall gotta keep up the chase. Just scream goodbye. Bleed butterfly whisper gotta crack break drop dead. Bleed butterfly whisper gotta fracture. Bleed butterfly whisper gotta crack break drop dead

5167,I’d just like to say. that I remember the day. that I first woke with you. Some days I have to admit. The way we happened to meet. Was strange because it was new.. I’m not drinking no more. Not drinking no less. Not sleeping at all. Never in the same bed. Undressed at the bar. Engraved bench in the park. We’d watch them fly Sundays.. Fly birds round my head again. Laughed at the words that you said. I pushed the boat back to you. I flew from the rain again. Killed you with what I said. You already knew.. Not thinking no more. Not drinking no less. Not sleeping at all. Never in the same bed. Undressed at the bar. Engraved bench in the park. We’d watch them fly Sundays.. They say if something should fly away. And it comes back to you again. Then it’s yours..
5168,Written by: Lenny Kravitz. I want to fall in love again. For the first time. Makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine. I want to press your lips on mine. For the first time. Makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine. Love is something. You can't get in a five and dime. And love is the question of more time. And love is something. That's really hard to find. Love makes a strong man. Get down on his knees in the crowd. Just lay your hand. On mine. Yeah for the first time. Makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine.
5169,Into each life some rain falls. Then comes the snow. But after the snow. The flowers will grow. Girl when my life got stormy. You stayed for the ride. You stayed my side. You make the sun shine. (Chorus:). I'm up again I never let you down. Nothing's ever gonna stop me now. Up again I never let you down. I love you. This Humpty Dumpty's lucky. He's had his fall. But after it all. He brushed himself off. Knowing how much you loved me. I made one more try. I reached for the sky. And I made it this time. (Chorus). I'm up again I never let you down. Nothing's ever gonna stop me now. Up again I never let you down. I love you
5170,You and I. We're like fireworks and symphonies. Exploding in the sky. With you I'm alive. Like all the missing pieces of my heart. They finally collide. So stop time right here in the moonlight. Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes. Without you I feel broke. Like I'm half of a whole. Without you I've got no hand to hold. Without you I feel torn. Like a sail in a storm. Without you I'm just a sad song. I'm just a sad song. With you I fall. It's like I'm leaving all my past. In silhouettes up on the wall. With you I'm a beautiful mess. It's like we're standing hand in hand. With all our fears up on the edge. So stop time right here in the moonlight. Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes. Without you I feel broke. Like I'm half of a whole. Without you I've got no hand to hold. Without you I feel torn. Like a sail in a storm. Without you I'm just a sad song. You're the perfect melody. The only harmony. I wanna hear. You're my favorite part of me. With you standing next to me. I've got nothing to fear. Without you I feel broke. Like I'm half of a whole. Without you I've got no hand to hold. Without you I feel torn. Like a sail in a storm. Without you I'm just a sad song. Without you I feel broke. Like I'm half of a whole. Without you I've got no hand to hold. Without you I feel torn. Like a sail in a storm. Without you I'm just a sad song. I'm just a sad song
5171,I'm shufflin' thru the Texas sand. but my head's in Mississippi.. I'm shufflin' thru the Texas sand. but my head's in Mississippi.. The blues has got a hold of me.. I believe I'm gettin' dizzy. (Spoken: Help me now.). I keep thinkin' 'bout that night in Memphis. Lord I thought I was in Heaven.. I keep thinkin' 'bout that night in Memphis. I thought I was in Heaven.. But I was stumblin' thru the parking lot. of an invisible seven eleven. (Spoken: What was I doin out there?). Where's my head baby?. Somewhere in Mississippi.. Last night I saw a cowgirl.. She was floatin' across the ceiling.. And last night I saw a naked cowgirl.. She was floatin' across the ceiling.. She was mumblin to some howlin' wolf. about some voodoo healin'. (Spoken: Mmm Baby.).
5172,I would rather stay here. Where the flowers bloom and the sun it shines. It shines on you. It lights up your eyes. Sitting here all by ourselves counting all the poeple. They ask us why. They gather all around to stare on down. Into a dark dark pit. Don't go please don't go. But they step on in they fall all in. They walk all over you. One step at a time they all walk in a line. Down a false false hope. I would rather stay here. Where the flowers bloom and the sun it shines. It shines on you. It lights up your eyes. I would rather stay here. Where the moon it glows. Soaring doves and falling crows. Laughter is the only sound here. If I had one wish I'd fill up that pit. I'd fill up that pit. I'd cry till it fill up to the brim. You'd swim to the top and I'd grab your hand. . How can I how can I convince you to stay. Where all the flowers bloom and the grass it sways?. And the rain it pours and the waves all roar. And the trees they grow and the falling crow. Soars down into that dark cold pit. And you follow it in. Oh you follow it in. I would rather stay here. Where the flowers bloom and the sun it shines. It shines on you. It lights up your eyes. I would rather stay here. Where the moon it glows. Soaring doves and falling crows. Laughter is the only sound here. If I had one wish I'd fill up that pit. I'd fill up that pit. I'd cry till it fill to the brim. You'd swim to the top and I'd grab your hand
5173,Life could slip away in absent minded numbness. I'm only sayin this 'cuz I wish for the best. When you always stay in self-incarceration. I thinks it's such a shame. Don't stay home this time no don't stay home. If he don't have to he don't want to. Don't stay home this time no don't say no. Oh how I'd like to diffuse your time bomb anger. It's screaming danger danger this kind of world. Don't care if you're home so you better get some. Don't stay home this time no don't stay home. If he don't have to he don't want to. Don't stay home this time no don't say no. Everything I'm sayin' you can dismiss. Because I sat alone on this past Christmas. I deserved to be alone. But I guess I should have gone home. Hey don't break the mold kid just eat around it. Yeah that's what I did. I'll be running around the block. For no apparent reason. Somethin' you'll catch me doin' in any season. Gotta break a sweat man gotta go bust out. Biddy by by by by. Good-bye to the drout yea. Don't stay home this time no don't stay home. If he don't have to he don't want to. Don't stay home this time no don't say no. Don't stay home this time no don't stay home. If he don't have to he don't want to. Don't stay home this time no don't stay home. .
5174,Are we still not speaking?. Bitter words leave such a bitter taste. Yes I meant to hurt you. But it was never meant to go as far as this. And still I can make no sense out of these things that I do. And I still put myself through this version of hell. Just put you through it too. Yes I know I started it. But you shouldn't say those things you say. I always thought people were meant to learn by their mistakes. But it never seems to work out that way. Nothing's ever good enough for me or good enough for you. So I still drag myself through this version of hell. Just to drag you through it too. Sweat on the dancefloor. Blood from the broken glass. No favours ever given no favours ever asked. This strange kind of communion. As these empty words are played.
5177,Kiss for a kiss. My two lips got you racing. Baby we're guilty whatever we are. Angel confess let me be your salvation. I'll carry you through the dark. Let me give. Let me give you something to believe in. You don't gotta. You don't gotta even have a reason. (you don't even gotta. You don't even gotta have a reason). You can love me.

5182,We're not the first I hope we're not the last. 'Cause I know we're all heading for that adult crash. The time is so little the time belongs to us. Why is everybody in such a fucking rush?!.

5183,I Cord of Life. A man conceived a moment's answer to the dream. Staying the flowers daily sensing all the themes. As a foundation left to create the spiral aim. A movement regained and regarded both the same. All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you. Changed only for a sight of sound the space agreed. Between the picture of time behind the face of need. Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid. Emotions revealed as the ocean maid. All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you. Coins and crosses. (Turn round tailor assauting). Never know their fruitless worth. (all the mornings of the interest shown. presenting one another to the cord). Cords are broken. (All left dying rediscovered. Of the door that turned round). Locked inside the mother Earth. (To close the cover all the. interest shown). They won't hide hold they won't tell you. (To turn one another to the. sign at the time float your climb). Watching the world watching all of the world. Watching us go by. And you and I climb over the sea to the valley. And you and I reached out for reasons to call. II Eclipse. Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid. Emotions revealed as the ocean maid. As a movement regained and regarded both the same. All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you. III The preacher the teacher. Sad preacher nailed upon the coloured door of time. Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme. There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify. Political ends as sad remains will die. Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you. Oooh ooh. I listened hard but could not see. Life tempo change out and inside me. The preacher trained in all to lose his name. The teacher travels asking to be shown the same. In the end we'll agree we'll accept we'll immortalize. That the truth of man maturing in his eyes. All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you. Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid. As a moment regained and regarded both the same. Emotion revealed as the ocean maid. A clearer future mornig evening nights with you. IV Apocalypse. And you and I climb crossing the shapes of the morning. And you and I reach over the sun for the river. And you and I climb clearer towards the movement. And you and I called over valleys of endless seas.
5184,Mother tell me. I long to hear the stories. Just like long ago. All these memories start. to fade before me. I cannot let them go. No I can't let them go. [chorus]. From the cradle to the grave. It's a fear I can't escape. Who will be my hiding place. when you're gone?. Father stay here. Don't leave me like the other. No I need you so. All you gave me father how you loved me. Treated like your own. Don't ever let me go. [chorus]. From the cradle to the grave. It's a fear I can't escape. Who will be my hiding place. when you're gone?. There's no way to deny the brevity of life. As time keeps marching on. all we have is lost. As time keeps marching on. all we have is lost. Nothing lasts forever nothing stays the same. [chorus]. From the cradle to the grave. It's a fear I can't escape. Who will be my hiding place. when you're gone?. From the cradle to the grave. It's a fear I can't escape. Who will be my hiding place. when you're gone?. How am I to carry on?. How am I to carry on?. (as time keeps marching on). How am I to carry on?. (all we have is lost). Nothing lasts forever. nothing ever stays the same

5187,"Written by Roger McGuinn. Happiness hit me on the first day that we met. She was sitting in my kitchen with a face I can't forget. She was looking my direction and calling with her eyes. I was trying to do an interview and telling them all lies. Last year in the summer with a tiffany lamp over her head. They were asking what I thought about the 50's rock n roll. Then they got into their limousine and fell into a hole. I moved into the kitchen and I quickly fell in love. The warden came along and asked me what I was thinking of. Last year in the summer with a tiffany lamp over her head. Well I grabbed her by the hand and with a few things I could. The warden said ""You're leaving well you better leave for good!"". I made it to Tasmania to buy a devil dog. We were met by a young handsome prince who turned into a frog. Last year in the summer with a tiffany lamp over her head. Now we're living out in Malibu the ocean by our side. Laying in the sunshine drifting with the tide. But happiness had hit me on the first day that we met. She was sitting in my kitchen with a face I can't forget. Last year in the summer with a tiffany lamp over her head. Over her head."

5194,Until all the things I feel. Replace all the things you did. I will remain a stranger. In every place you hid. Don't ask me to be your hero. Those stories are never real. And if I fall from danger. Too close to the way I feel. I feel what I used to fear. I know what I need to hear. I can't keep wasting time. Why can't we just leave it all behind. The things it takes to make up. May seem to bring me down. It's not that I don't want you. You're someone like me around. I feel what I used to fear. I know what I need to hear. I can't keep wasting time. Why can't we just leave it all behind. I wonder if you know. The truth is far too cold. But if I could frame your soul. I'd never let go. I feel what I used to fear. I know what I need to hear. I can't keep wasting time. Why can't we just leave it all. Why can't we just leave it all. Why can't we just leave it all behind. By larita bell

5198,I have lived in Neville's Cross. But it's not famous for me. That's the opening line. Of an ancient song of mine. We had great fun trying to play. Every other Wednesday. No-one had seen. Such a greatest hits machine. All coming through the mirrors. I threw away old verses we would play. Those words were too wild for us. But I still love the chorus. It always rains in Durham County. Your ears are raw and your hair is wet. But don't you worry in Durham County. What you're really feeling you soon forget. We won't be told that the past was pure gold. We were there and it wasn't. Once in a while let's look and smile. To the days when buses brought us. To the home of Ansa Motors. It always rains in Durham County. Your ears are raw and your hair is wet. But don't you worry in Durham County. What you're really feeling you soon forget. It always rains in Durham County. Though moments of laughter sometimes intervene. The days are complex in Durham County. Or they are simple or in between yeah yeah
5200,I feel like a boy with a problem. I can't believe what we've forgotten. And I even slapped your face and made you cry. It's the last thing I want to do. Pull the curtains on me and you. Pull the carpet from under love. Pull out like young lovers do. You swore you wouldn't shout. If it's not your punch then its your pout. Days in silence try my temper. Nights spent drinking to remember. How memories are always tender. I crept out last night behind your back. The little they know might be the pieces I lack. Came home drunk. Talking in circles. The spirit is willing but I don't believe in miracles. I've got a problem but let's go to bed. I can roll over and I can play dead. But here I am in the doghouse instead. I feel like a boy with a problem. I can't believe all you've forgotten.

I thought it was a ripple and nothing more. But the wave found its way all the way to the shore. Oh oh I wanna burn this house. I know I wanna jump into the fire. Oh oh gotta tear them down.

5224,I'm tired of letting go all that I've tried to have. I'm tired of wasting time looking up to the wrong stars. I do believe in life and that everything is written. But life is not a book with pages wide-opened. Don't search too far my mother says. Sometimes all that you need is only a step away. Look into yourself. The one and only. Look into yourself. If you want to find the key. A look into yourself. Release your heart free. Look into yourself. And be the master of your destiny. Don't be afraid of wanting changes in your life. Don't be afraid to go to wherever you decide. Believe in yourself and believe in what you can do. And no one can deny the will that lies in you. Try to pay more attention. And live your life with good intentions. Look into yourself. The one and only. Look into yourself. If you want to find the key. A look into yourself. Release your heart free. Look into yourself. And be the master of your destiny. Look into yourself. Cause there's a rainbow. Look into yourself. There is so much more that you need to know. Cause in yourself. There's serenity. It's all in yourself. You are the master of your destiny. For every doubt you face. In every step you take. For choices that you make. Dreams aren't made to be erased. Just look into yourself... Look into yourself. The master of your destiny... It's in yourself. The master of your destiny. It's in yourself..
5226,Goodbye. Hasn't been so good to me. Stepped out into the night. Back against the moon. I saw ten thousand hands with candlelight. We all think that we're right. It's hard to tell. If the night is full of hope or doom. My eyes. Burn with unshed tears. My body is weak. From so many silent years. Too many people say goodbye. Before they say hello. Step into the morning.

5230,"Another bride another June. Another sunny honeymoon. Another season another reason. For makin' whoopee. A lot of shoes a lot of rice. The groom is nervous he answers twice. Its really killin' that he's so willin'. To make whoopee. Picture a little love nest. Down where the roses cling. Picture the same sweet love nest. And think what a year can bring. He's washin' dishes and baby clothes. He's so ambitious he even sews. But don't forget folks. That's what you get folks for makin' whoopee. Another year or maybe less. What's this I hear? Well you can guess. She feels neglected and he's suspected. Of making whoopee. She sits alone most every night. He doesn't phone; he doesn't write. He says he's busy but she says ""Is he?"". He's making whoopee. He doesn't make much money; only 5000 per. Some judge who thinks he's funny. Says you'll pay 6 to her. He says ""Now judge suppose I fail?"". The judge says: ""Budge right into jail"". You'd better keep her I think it's cheaper. Than making whoopee"

5233,You know I feel a little spaced out. I can't hardly see my feet on the ground. I hear voices from the outside. All I wander is if you care about me. Oh my God I wish I could talk to you. And tell those things that I know by heart. Then I'll get much closer and kiss your lips. You might think I'm fresh. But if you please don't take me wrong. All I want is that you get to want me. Don't take me wrong. Oh meu Brasil!!!

5236,Like a fresh manifestation of an old phenomenon. A breeze whips through the trees. The rustling leaves and branches bend together. they’re cued to sway. forever by the forces of the Lord’s choreography. Just for a second the combination of sights sounds. around him. sends him hurtling back to the mirror of all of his teenager thoughts and fears. He passes big houses and family cars. they saddled the horses in cobblestone yards. He catches the moon looking down from the stars. Just like it’s done for years and years. Perpetual feeling in the grown up world that’s all. around him. that there’s secrets that could be revealed with knowledge and philosophy. And “Oh to be dumb Oh to be smart”. He might be nursing a broken heart. but feeling this way he’s just playing a part. that’s been around for centuries. I wandered all night I wondered all night about you. I’ve been here for years just wandering around the neighbourhood.
5239,Light of the world. Are you still here?. And are we illuminating?. When love becomes a delicate display. So weak dissolved by anything. Love lies here waiting all alone. Can a king be a king. Weighed down?. Our hearts a bubble maker's dream. Moved on by winds of everything. As we deny that love is still the king. Not as weak as we make him out to be. Love lies here waiting all alone. Can a king be a king. Weighed down?. Weighed down. Weighed down. Weighed down. Weighed down.
5240,by Patti Smith. . In the straw-colored light. In light rapidly changing. On a life rapidly fading. Have you seen death singing. Have you seen death singing. With a throat smooth as a lamb. Yet dry as a branch not snapping. He throws back his head. And he does not sing a thing mournful. Have you seen death singing. Have you seen death singing. Have you seen death singing. In the straw-colored light. He sings a black embrade. And white opals swimming. In a child's leather purse. Have you seen death swimming. Have you seen death swimming. With a throat smooth as a lamb. Yet dry as a branch not snapping. He throws back his head. And he does not sing a thing mournful. Have you seen death singing. Have you seen death singing. Have you seen death singing. In the straw-colored light. He sings of youth enraged. And the burning of Atlanta. And these viral times. And May ribbons streaming. And straw-colored curls a-turning. A mother's vain delight. And woe to the sun. And woe to the young. Another hearse is drawn. Have you seen death singing.
5242,Oh I don't complain when she squeezes me. Cos she's heavy. And I don't complain when she teases me. Cos she's heavy. Oh I don't complain when she turns up late. Asks me out I don't hesitate. Gor a lot more loving with a lot more weight. Chorus. And she's heavy  and she's heavy. And she's heavy and she's heavy. Oh I don't object when she cooks a lot. Cos she's heavy. And I don't object when she calls the shots. Cos she's ready. She might need to lose just a pound or two. The lady knows how to bill and coo. Got so much more I can hold on to. Chorus. No no no no more tonight. I can see what you bin saving. No no no no more tonight. I can see you're misbehaving. When her temper rises she can shake the ground. And she's heavy. And there's plenty there to put your arms around. And she's ready. Her profile leaves you in no doubt. It's hard to handle such a big amount. See her through my eyes it's what's inside that counts
5243,made a resolution and I plan to keep my work. But I need you to make it work. You’ve got to read the message understand what’s on my mind. Cause not to see would be a crime. And we could lose it anytime. We’ve got to show some respect. We’ve got to learn to protect. Don’t take it for granted I know. That if you want to stay close. We’ve got to show some respect.

For the things that I love about you. From the woman that you see inside. Don’t let it walk out the door. Love follows everytime

Blinking at the vanishing point of what I thought. Staring down the barrel of the middle distance. God knows I tried I close my eyes. I close my eyes. I close my eyes. I greet despair to a standard prayer. If you call for the future I don’t care. And I don’t mean *** to face me here aha. There’s a compass raised with familiar tone. With a voice that needles me to the bone. Staring down the barrel of the middle distance. God knows I tried. I close my eyes. I close my eyes. I close my eyes. Whose position shifts cause its been effect. If you can't hit play cause the button sticks. Ignorance is bliss I can’t say. There’s a compass raised with familiar tone. With a voice that needles you to the bone. You’re left with chaos static and delay. Staring down the barrel of the middle distance. Staring down the barrel of the middle distance. God knows I tried I close my eyes. I close my eyesI close my eyes. Staring down the barrel of the middle distance. God Knows I tried. I close my eyes

I drank a poco loco and I'd never be the same. I met up with some boys. They called themselves the diamond dogs. They were either on the dancefloor. Or dealing in the bogs. And a reformed gangster got me. And he said that he found god. He looked me in the eyes. And he started speaking tongues. Speaking tongues speaking tongues. Everybody on the island speaking tongues. Speaking tongues speaking tongues. Everybody on the island speaking tongues. Everybody's sayin' take that take that. And I'm about to do exactly that-ah. And I'm the cheeky fucker at the back-ah.

They told me if they come for you my brother. We will go for them. I whistled down a taxi. Just to save us all some grief. The taxi man had weed. And pills he'd bought from the police.

And taken back all that she gave. You knew that nothing was something to do. The sea and the sky shine blue. I tried but I could not get though. And later I wonder how I've been wiser then. Would we be there still there. Black rocking chairs black rocking chairs. The silence was something you seen. The wind pushing over the trees. You taught me that nothing is free. And later I wonder how I've been wiser then. Would we be there still there. Black rocking chairs black rocking chairs

Who you think is really kickin' tunes?. Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube. Like you lit the fuse. You think it's fictional. Mystical? Maybe. Spiritual.

Without it you make it. Allow me to make this. Childlike in nature. Rhythm. You have it or you don't that's a fallacy. I'm in them. Every sprouting tree. Every child apiece. Every cloud and sea. You see with your eyes. I see destruction and demise. Corruption in disguise. From this fucking enterprise. Now I'm sucking to your lies. Through Russel not his muscles. but the percussion he provides. with me as a guide. But y'all can't see me now. Cos you don't see with your eye. You perceive with your mind. That's the inner. So I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor. Bust a few rhymes so mother fuckers. Remember what the thought is. I brought all this. So you can survive when law is lawless. Feelings sensations that you thought were dead. No squealing remember. (That it's all in your head). I ain't happy I'm feeling glad. I got sunshine in a bag. I'm useless but not for long. The future is coming on. I ain't happy I'm feeling glad. I got sunshine in a bag. I'm useless but not for long. My future is coming on. It's coming on. It's coming on. It's coming on. It's coming on. My future is coming on. It's coming on. It's coming on. It's coming on. My future is coming on. It's coming on. It's coming on. It's coming on. My future is coming on. It's coming on. It's coming on.

5303,(Rod Stewart). Did you ever stand and shiver. while looking at a freezing river. Have you froze to the bone. with just a coat to keep you warm. to keep you from a howlin' wind. to keep you from a howlin' wind. Now listen. Have you perished in the drizzling rain. Tried to light ... a lift but all in vain. With your sock on your head. and that old coat on your back. to keep you from the drizzlin' rain. oh to keep you from the drizzlin' rain. Goodbye. One more time. Did you sleep in a graveyard when it snowed. Laid your head on a ...... With the Times on your face. and that old coat on your back. That kept you from a-withering away good God. It just kept you from a-withering away. I know. And did you ride a lift on a steam train. Now listen. Had the misfortune not to pay your fare. Thrown off the next stop. Thrown in the doorway of a shop. With that coat to keep you from the wind. Oh that old school coat to keep you from the wind. And that ain't all. Have you had some good friends on the road with ya. who'd stand by you through thick and thin. Here's to Kevin and Ben Susie and Len. And that coat which never lets you down. It never never never lets you down. It never never never lets you down. That old coat which never lets you down. That old coat which never lets you down. Kept me from the drizzlin' rain. And oh kept me from the drizzlin' rain.
5304,If this isn't what you see. It doesn't make you blind. If this doesn't make you feel. It doesn't mean you've died. Where the river's high. Where the river's high. If you don't want to be seen. You don't have to hide. If you don't want to believe. You don't have to try. To feel alive. Alive in the superunknown. First it steals your mind. And then it steals your soul. If this doesn't make you free. It doesn't mean you're tied. If this doesn't take you down. It doesn't mean you're high. If this doesn't make you smile. You don't have to cry. If this isn't making sense. It doesn't make it lies. Alive in the superunknown. First it steals your mind. And then it steals your soul. Get yourself afraid. Get yourself alone. Get yourself contained. Get yourself control. Alive in the superunknown. First it steals your mind. And then it steals your... soul. Music: Thayil Cornell; Lyrics: Cornell.
5305,(Rod Stewart / Chen Savigar Cregan Grainger). Look at all the problems. That we've been through. How can you tell me. That there's somebody new. I don't believe that I'm hearing this. I don't really think that you're serious. Well you picked a fine time to hesitate. See it my way I've nothing left. You can take my heart but don't steal my pride. Think it over before I'm pushed aside. And tell me. Say it ain't true. That's all you gotta do baby. Say it ain't true. Well I thought this one was bound to last. Together forever oh what a laugh. It's going to hurt when I set you free. I've been loving you too long. You're a part of me. So tell me. Say it ain't true Tell me baby. Say it ain't true. Put yourself in my place for a little while. Going out of fashion growing out of style. No one to laugh with nobody to share. No one to lean on nobody to care. Nothing left but a memory. I gave you my heart so stay with me. And tell me. Say it ain't true. Say it ain't true. Tell me baby. Say it ain't true. I love you baby. I love you baby. I just want to do right by you honey. Wouldn't do you no wrong.
5307,"My friend bill lives down in the projects. Stays drunk all the time. He makes mustang wine. He makes mustang wine. He makes mustang wine and he stays drunk all the time.

5308,Here I stand. Empty hands. Wishing my wrists were bleeding. To stop the pain from the beatings. There you stood. Holding me. Waiting for me to notice you. But who are you. You are the truth (you are the truth). Outscreaming these lies. You are the truth (you are the truth). Saving my life. The warmth of your embrace. Melts my frostbitten spirit. You speak the truth and I hear it. The words are I love you. And I have to believe in you. But who are you. You are the truth (you are the truth). Outscreaming these lies. You are the truth (you are the truth). Saving my life. My hands are open. And you are filling them. Hands in the air. In the air in the air in the air. And I worship. And I worship. And I worship
5309,I could be your operator. I could bring you joy. Something like a freedom fighter. Guns ain't just for boys. I heard what you said. You should say it again. Cause it's bold bold. It's getting late. Darling get a move on it. We should go go. You should never tell your mother. You could give it time. Pour a drink here have another. Cause this is gonna blow your mind. Heard what you said. And I say what I mean. We should go go. Pack up your things. I don't care what you bring. Leave your house for a home. You should call your little brother. Tell him to be good. Tell him that you really love him. You don't but you should. I heard what you said. So don't say it again. Cause it's cold cold. It's getting late. Darling get a move on it. We should go go. I could be your moneymaker. You could be my song. Worry 'bout the others later. We should get a move on. We should go go. Pack up your things. I don't care what you bring. Leave your house for a home
5310,(unreleased demo). Keep telling myself. Get out of my mind. The way he feels. He feels so right. Every night I feel the heat. I close my eyes and he comes to me. I confess I have done wrong. But in your eyes I see a guilt. I am guilty. Stress that keeps me strong. I feel it with all my heart is empty. Cause you're not with me. In my secret place. Where I drift the way. (CHORUS). Tell me. am I sinner?. Tell me. am I wrong?. Something is wrong with the pictures. This is not my fault. So am I a sinner?. Am I a sinner?. Don't watch the truth and fault. Please don't try to see right through me. When do you touch me?. You will never know. Imagination starts to haunt me. It controls me. In my secret place. Where I drift the way. (CHORUS)
5311,Say hello from your window. Say goodbye from your car. Say goodnight from your pillow. Say so long from the stars. Take a walk out of my life. Sing to me a lullaby. Cradle songs for a midlife. Don't forget to pass me by. My imagination runs away. On this 8th avenue serenade. Meet me at the bathroom stall. Meet me at the Whispering Wall. Before all the flames burn out. My imagination runs away. On this 8th avenue serenade. Meet me at the bathroom stall. See you at the Whispering Wall. Before all the flames burn out.

5313,Not sure what tomorrow brings. Not sure why a caged bird sings. Don't ask cause I don't know. No idea just where to go. High hopes and higher dreams. May not have everything. I promise to be good. I'll be good for you. Hard work and harder times. As long as you say you are mine. We'll see the other side together. It's not losing it all if we have each other.

5314,I knew of two sisters whose name it was Christmas. And one was named Dawn of course the other one was named Eve. I wonder if they grew up hating the season. Of the good will that lasts till the Feast of St. Stephen. For that is the time to eat drink and be merry. 'Til the beer is all spilled and the whiskey is flowed. And the whole family tree you neglected to bury. Are feeding their faces until they explode. [Chorus:]. There'll be laughter and tears over Tia Marias. Mixed up with that drink made from girders. And it's all we've got left as you draw your last breath. And it's nice for the kids as you've finally got rid of them. In the St Stephen's Day Murders. Uncle is garglin' a heart-breaking air. While the babe in his arms pulls out all that remains of his hair. And we're not drunk enough yet to dare criticize. The great big kipper tie he's about to baptize. His gin-flavoured whispers and kisses of sherry. His best crimble shirt flung out over the shop. While the lights from the Christmas tree blow up the telly. His face closes in like an old cold pork chop. And the carcass of the beast left over from the feast. May still be found haunting the kitchen. And there's life in it yet we may live to regret. When the ones that we poisoned stop twitchin'
5315,I won't let anybody hurt you. And I'll stop them if they try to. Nobody knows you like I do ba-a-by.. And I don't care where you run to. Because I am gonna find you.

(Wooooh) You're exactly what I wanted. (Wooooh) And exactly what I need. (Wooooh) Don't need anybody but my ba-a-by-y-y. So where did all your love go?. You played me like a solo. Then you threw my broken heart awa-a-ay. And I know that we can make it. And more closer I can feel it. So stop fooling around and just sta-a-ay-ay-ay. (Chorus:). (Wooooh) Is anybody out there?. (Wooooh) Can anybody see?. (Wooooh) It seems like everything's gone cra-a-zy-y-y. (Wooooh) You're exactly what I wanted. (Wooooh) And exactly what I need. (Wooooh) Don't need nobody but my ba-a-by-y-y. (PJ Morton:). It's taking such a long time. To find what I've been looking for. And now that you are all mine. I never felt crying like this before. Still want more. Oh! You're reading my mind!. Because it's so and you already know. You're all that I want and you're all that I needed-e-e-ed. Ya-a-yaaay. (Chorus:). (Wooooh) Is anybody out there?.

(Wooooh) Don't need anybody but my ba-a-by-y-y. (Chorus:). (Wooooh) Is anybody out there?. (Wooooh) Can anybody see?. (Wooooh) It seems like everything's gone cra-a-zy-y-y. (Wooooh) You're exactly what I wanted. (Wooooh) And exactly what I need. (Wooooh) Don't need nobody but my ba-a-by-y-y

5317,Tell me the story now. Now that it's over. Wrap it in glory. For one Irish Rover. Tell me you wiser now. Tell me you older. Wrap it in glory. For one Irish Rover. Bridge:. I can tell by the light in your eye. That you're so far away. Like a ship out on the sea. Without a sail you've gone astray. Tell me the facts real straight. Don't make me over. Make it come out alright. And wrap it in glory. For one Irish Rover. For one Irish Rover. One Irish Rover. One Irish Rover.
5318,You're like a moon that's full. Across a sea of foam. I'm the sky you've been burning. I don't think you even understand. I thought I held you by the hand. I thought I held you. I'm like a songwriter;. You're the reason I've run out. Run out of metaphors. I don't think you even understand. I thought I held you by the hand. I thought I held you. I thought I held you.
5320,Can I listen to this song. Without crying. Can I listen to these words. Without dying. Maybe good times I'll remember. Bad times I'll ignore. Cause I don't want to feel. Like a black rain cloud anymore. Can I think about the way. We were together. Can I give a little rain. For better weather. Let the sun come shining through. Just like it did before. Cause I don't want to feel. Like a black rain cloud anymore. Did I hold on for so long for love. Or was it just jealousy. Was I doing everything for you. Or did I do it for me. If I saw you walking by. Before you saw me. Would I run and try to hide. And if you called me. Could I answer you and say. The rain will never pour. Cause I don't want to feel. Like a black rain cloud anymore

Look at me don't hold your head down. Weren't we some shit we can turn it all round. It'll take some work. It might sound like I'm making some excuses. When I say baby I'm just a man. Just a flash in pants. Something that I didn't plan. But it's all I gotta give. And for you I shed a tear. [Chorus]. I dropped a tear in the ocean. When they find it that's when I'll stop loving you. Now I'm lost in a sea of emotion. Forever blinded falling deeper into the blue. OOh you'll never find my tears in the ocean. OOh they'll never find my tears

5324,His hands hide inside a sleeve. and little feet play with the ground beneath him. while up in the sky is where he wants to be. Time will fly. and the wind plays with him. the night will give him its charm. While he walks home. his head's up in a cloud. he feels his pores fill up with fresh air. and there is no doubt. that one day he will be. where the eye of his telescope has already been. Night will pass. but he's a lot faster. no one can do him any harm
5325,Maybe I didn't treat you. Quite as good as I should. Maybe I didn't love you. Quite as often as I could. Little things I should have said and done. I never took the time. You were always on my mind. You were always on my mind(2x). Maybe I didn't hold you. All those lonely lonely times. But I guess I never told you. I'm so happy that you're mine. If I made you feel second best. I'm sorry I was blind. You were always on my mind. You were always on my mind. Tell me tell me that your sweet love hasn't died. Give me one more chance. To keep you satisfied satisfied. You were always on my mind. You were always on my mind(2x)

5336,Shapes of things before my eyes. Just teach me to despise. Will time make men more wise?. Here within my lonely frame. My eyes just hurt my brain. But will it seem the same?. Come tomorrow will I be older?. Come tomorrow may be a soldier. Come tomorrow may I be bolder than today?. Now the trees are almost green. But will they still be seen. When time and tide have been?. Oh into your passing hands. Please don't destroy these lands. Don't make them desert sands.. . (copyright 1966 b.feldman & co. ltd.).
5337,She is an American car. She isn't legal so she can't go far.. She got her mind stuck up in second gear. Where she going ain't exactly clear.. Baby please baby please I wanna drive you home.. Low mileage without a pink slip. Clean upholstery and it ain't been ripped.. She stripped her gears only late last night. I don't think that thing was oiling right.. Baby please baby please I wanna drive you home.. She shakes and shimmies all over the road. She's always happy when she carry a load.. Another lonesome automobile. Something bout the way she makes me feel.. Baby please baby please I wanna drive you home..

I knew what I liked was not very much. High at the time tied to the grid. Always afraid of those normal American kids. Oh all of my spirit leaked like a cut. I knew what I needed would never be enough. I was too high to change my bid. Always afraid to be a normal american kid. Always hating normal normal american empty summer days. Lightning crazed and cracked like an egg. High behind the garden shed. Painting myself as a normal American kid. I always hated it. High as high as high can loom. Under the sheets in my bedroom. I was high as high can get. Always afraid of those normal American kids. Oh bongs and jams and carpeted vans. Hate everything I don't understand. Hard times tightening the lid. I had to get away from those normal American kids. Always hated those normal American kids. Always hated those normal American kids

5381,My life flows on in endless song. Above earth's lamentation.. I hear the real thought far off hymn. That hails the new creation. Above the tumult and the strife. I hear the music ringing;. It sounds an echo in my soul. How can I keep from singing?. What through the tempest loudly roars. I hear the truth it liveth.. What through the darkness round me close. Songs in the night it giveth.. No storm can shake my inmost calm. While to that rock I'm clinging.. Since love is lord of Heaven and earth. How can I keep from singing?. When tyrants tremble sick with fear. And hear their death-knell ringing. When friends rejoice both far and near. How can I keep from singing?. In prison cell and dungeon vile. Our thoughts to them are winging.. When friends by shame are undefiled. How can I keep from singing?
