# S64 Training for the hackathon, part 2

This SLU is optional, to be done after completing the SLUs 11-19. It is meant to prepare you for the hackathon. In this second part of the training, you will improve the baseline from SLU32. You will train more models and optimized models and the model hyperparameters.

This SLU does not have exercises with asserts like you have done until now, it is just a guided tour.
